                [2023/06/01 16:31:29]:Nash:Hi Peter, I’ve checked your admission, it meets the “assured admission” of UH, but it does not meet the requirement of the major you wanted. For Cullen/Business, you need a 3.25 overall, compared to CLASS where you need a 2.5.
                [2023/06/01 16:31:29]:Nash:I think you may consider changing your major and apply again.
                [2023/06/01 16:31:29]:Amy:OK, thank you for your help.",
