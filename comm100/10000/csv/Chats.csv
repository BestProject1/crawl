[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Hello sir
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yes?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I have a denied transfer admission.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Bit I met assured admission req?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: What is wrong?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Let me check. Your name please?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Peter Parker.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: OK. Please wait. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi Peter, I’ve checked your admission, it meets the “assured admission” of UH, but it does not meet the requirement of the major you wanted. For Cullen/Business, you need a 3.25 overall, compared to CLASS where you need a 2.5. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: I think you may consider changing your major and apply again. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: OK, thank you for your help. ",6/1/2023 16:31

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I am currently a student at UH College of Education. Want to transfer to the Bauer business school.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sure. You can do that. May I know your name please? 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Daniel Smith. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I will have 34 credits at the end of this semester. The baser information site has confusing gpa requirements. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi Daniel, it doesn’t matter. I will help you. Please wait. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: I checked that the transfer to Bauer business school needs 3.25 GPA
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh, but I should have a 3.0 GPA by the end of this semester.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Is this OK? Or should I wait till next semester and a higher gpa to change majors?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sorry, I think Bauer business is pretty strict about the 3.25, as bauer is becoming more popular and respected. And you cannot change your major to pre-business after you hit 45 credits. So I think you may not be able to do that unless you can get 3.25 GPA by the end of this semester. Sorry for that. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh god. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: OK. Thanks anyway.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I am wondering if I should try to obtain an In-State Tuition waiver before classes begin.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I have learned that there is a form that needs to be submitted within the first 10 days of classes.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi Peter, thanks for waiting. I think you will automatically get in-state tuition waiver. You don’t need to do anything.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: No, we have Spring transfer too. Why are you asking?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Because while browsing the transfer admissions page, there weren’t any deadlines or talk of admission for the spring term. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So Will I be able to transfer for spring 2023?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yes.  The deadline won’t be posted until the fall class is in. But you will have this chance in Spring 2023.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I applied to UH in November and got accepted, but I'm worried that my grades in AP Cal and AP Bio will put my acceptance in jeopardy.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Why do you worry about that?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I didn't manage to do well in those specific classes. I don't necessarily need them to graduate high school and I'm worried about how it will affect me. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: From what I've seen on this sub, I will only get rescinded if I don't graduate high school? I don't really know. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Ah. Don’t worry, if you can graduate high school, that will be fine. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So it really only affects me if I don’t graduate High School?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yes.  If you got accepted already, it won’t affect you.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Hi I’m a senior in hs, just got rejected. Checked my application status on the portal and it said I did not meet admission requirements.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I’m a little confused because UH was the one school I was certain I could get into. I have a 3.8 GPA, top 20%.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: OK, please wait. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi Raymond, thanks for waiting. I checked that you did not submit test scores. Is this correct?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Yes. But it says the test scores are optional?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yes. It is optional. But UH only uses core classes for test-optional admissions. I think your GPA includes electives. So after recalculation your final GPA is 2.8 which does not meet the minimal requirement for the Major you applied for. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh god. What should I do?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sorry for that. I think if you want you can try to apply again for another major which does not have a very high requirement. Or you can try to forward your application to other universities.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Even if you aren't accepted into the major, you can still take the lower level courses while you work toward meeting the requirements to switch. If you do well on core courses then you can try to switch majors. It won’t be too hard.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Have you already submitted the application or not?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: No. Not yet.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Well, Are you in the Top 10 percent? This is a new policy. If you’re top 10% you have auto admission with or without test for any public university in Texas.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I’m in the top 20%, I think I will fall under the “assured admission” category.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Idk Why is that?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Did you pay your tuition before you get the scholarship?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Yes. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: OK, so this is why the scholarship changed to refund. Because you paid the total balance before the scholarship had the chance to disburse into your account.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh. So I shouldn’t do that?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: No. Don't pay the tuition in advance next time. You can do a payment plan with about three mouse clicks in AccessUH, then when the scholarships disburse the payment plan is paid with them. Your bank account, etc. Is never involved.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Here are my stats:
1490 SAT (800 EBRW, 690 Math)
4.0 GPA Unweighted; Homeschooled (with 7 dual enrollment classes)
Extracurriculars:
Community College Philosophy Club President (won't list the community college)
Community College Accounting Club Member
Competitive Swimming
Competitive Soccer
Homeschool Book Club Founder
150 Volunteer Hours
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: The Tier One scholarship is highly competitive, but with those scores and those extracurriculars I'd be gobsmacked to find that you aren't at least considered. I'd say you have very strong chances with those stats.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: OK. Thank you. I read that the median score for winners of the Tier One Scholarship is a 1470, so do you think having a 1460 puts me at a disadvantage.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Not in the slightest; that's close enough to the median that it will have zero detriment, and all those extracurriculars and volunteer hours (seriously, Philosophy Club president??) will be WAY more beneficial to your chances then being two questions' worth of points below the average SAT score might be detrimental.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: You've applied for the Honors College too, right? You'd be practically a shoe-in.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yes it is possible, but you have to send your FAFSA to both schools and both schools financial aid departments have to know about the other one.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh, how to do that?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: I suggest that you come to UH Financial Aid office in person and talk to them about your situation. The process is a little complicated, but they will definitely help you with that.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: You shouldn't be penalized on waiting for your aid to disburse. Usually the university is aware of the aid going to be disbursed, so you won't be charged late fees or anything.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: thanks so much! so was the EDL a good choice?

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: UH charges per class, not a flat amount per sem like some other colleges. It just depends on how many classes you take and how many credit hours they're worth (4 credit classes > 3 cred classes).

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Hi
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: For the installment pay plan, are we supposed to pay 25% with financial aid or without financial aid?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Financial aid is incorporated into the first payment, so you pay after your financial aid is depleted.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Seems  financial aid wasnt counted with the installment plan. Do you know why?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Financial aid is released to students a couple weeks after the first payment is due. So your second installment payment, depending on how much your financial aid is, will be less or completely eliminated.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Alright, don’t worry. What are the 3 three payment plans?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Or sorry. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: This. 
 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Short term Deferment Loan pushes back the due date of all costs and is only available to students living on campus.

Emergency Deferment Loan pushes ONLY tuition and mandatory fees and is available to everyone.

Installment Plan divides all costs into 4 payments and is available to all students. 1st payment due date does not change but the next 3 payments are spread out through the semester.

Typically you'd choose the first two if you're waiting on scholarships and loans and you know that they'd cover all costs.

Otherwise you pay all costs in one lump sum OR enroll in the installment Plan

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: No. you don’t have to worry about the grant disbursing the 12th day. you don’t have to pay for that.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: if your grant is $1500 and you owe $6000, you only have to pay $4500, despite the grant disbursing later.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I selected Short-Term Tuition Plan for this school year but something has me a little worried. There is a 12% APR on this plan and I was wondering if It gets added on to the payment I have to do on October 6th. Or is it like if I dont pay it on time?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: It’s added on to your payment the twelfth day after classes start as it’s a required part of the plan, if you have some financial aid I recommend doing the installment payment plan instead. The financial aid pays off as much of the first installment as it can so ideally your first installment would be paid off and you wouldn’t have to worry about payments till later in the year (with only a $25 origination fee). If that’s not an option for you and you have to do the short term plan you would have to pay that fee
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So the 12% interest gets added no matter what?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yeah unfortunately it’s university policy
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So its the whole 12% getting added on at the same time??? damn. Im still waiting on a big scholarship to come in. I'll try to change it to installment.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yeah installment is better since any financial aid can help cover your first installment and it’s only a $25 fee, good luck.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Hi, I am taking a class this summer and it is telling me I have to pay by tomorrow but it also sends some financial aid is still pending and when I go to pay I have to pay the full amount, not just the total it tells me after the financial aid is applied, so would I just pay all of it now and then financial aid would transfer to my bank or what? This is the first time taking a summer class at UH.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi, please follow these instructions. 
1.	you can check on your balance for the summer on myuh, go to ""student center"" and look on account balance and see total amount due, that will be the amount you have to pay after financial aid. Write it down.
2.	Then go to ""student financials"", there look to the left and click on "" make a payment"". Where it says online payment enter on "" payment amount"" the amount you wrote down before, that amount you have to pay after financial aid.
You don't have to pay the whole thing, just the portion you are responsible for after financial aid is applied. Once you pay that portion, you will see on ""student center"" that your total amount due is $0.00, because you paid the portion not covered by financial aid.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Would you please wait, let me try that now. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sure, take your time.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So when does the financial aid come? Does it come at the end of the school year?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: The financial aid is applied to your account at the beginning of the semester. After you are still enrolled full time by a certain date (like the 12th class day or something like that), then any balance left over will be refunded to you. Usually receive it about a month after school starts. You will want to sign up for the automatic deposit, otherwise they will send you a paper check which takes longer.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Your other financial aid shouldn't change. FYI, as I understand it, the Cougar Promise will only cover the rest of your tuition and fees. It will not cover housing and meal plan, if you are staying on campus.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Hi I got an email earlier today from the office of financial aid saying that is “The Texas Public Education Grant (TPEG) for Housing is a one-time award. To be eligible to receive this award, you must be living on-campus and enrolled in at least 9 credit hours each fall and spring semester.”
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: It says it’s a one-time award. I got the grant last year and then again this year, so does this mean it may have been an error and it’s going to be removed from my financial aid soon? 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: I believe the “one-time” means you can only get it one time for each application. So if you already got the grant this year, that won’t be taken away. And you can still apply for that next year. Sorry for the confusing description in the email.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I recently completed my FAFSA application for the 2022-2023 school year. It says that the expected family contribution is 5903. I had always been a recipient of the Federal Pell Grant. This is the first time I have been denied. My family does not pay for my tuition. I do so myself. I work full-time during the summers and part-time during the semesters to afford my full-time tuition. I save 100 percent of my checks to do so, but that is not enough to cover my tuition. I depend on the grant to pay the leftover amount.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: What should I do? Can I dispute this with the financial aid office?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Do you know why you were denied?

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I'm an incoming freshmen, and I received 2 or 3 grants this year. However, I heard that they give you less or even no grants at all after your freshman year. Is this true or does it just depend on your FAFSA for that year?

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi, that is not true. You will get grants depending on family income through FAFSA, unless your family greatly changes income upwards, you should have no issue.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Let me see, please wait. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: The Texas Public Education Book Grants are to help offset the cost of books and do not require any activity between you and the bookstore.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: The credit will be applied to your tuition balance. If you owe money to the University, it will reduce it by the amount of the grant. If it results in a credit balance, you should have a refund preference established so any credit balance is direct deposited into your own bank account. If you don't have a bank account, you can set up your Bank Mobile Vibe account. More information about getting your refund can be found here: https://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/refunds/

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: FAFSA grant depends on your credits. If you're taking 12 hours now, and after you drop a class you're at 9 hours, you'll be considered part time and you will lose some grant and scholarship money. If you stay at or above 12 credits you'll be fine.

[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: OK. Could you tell me what happened?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: so at the start of the semester I had been given the Texas Grant and it was about 9000 for both semesters, meaning about 4500 per semester. That was enough to get me by and I was alright. School started and everything was going good until yesterday when I got a disbursement notification saying that only about 1600 had been disbursed, and when I went to check my financial aid I had found that my Texas grant had been reduced to about 3200 for both semesters! I had already accepted the 9000 before the semester had begun, and I meet all the requirements for the Texas grant so I have no idea whats going on.
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: OK. Let me check for you. It’s Daniel House, right?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Yes. Please. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: OK, please wait. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi Daniel, I check that the Texas Grant dropped reason is because your income changed this year. It is higher than last year, right?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Yes, a little higher. But I don’t think it should affect so much. And how can I NOT be notified about this?
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sorry, I cannot see the details of that. I think the best option is to visit the Financial Aid office in Monday and talk with the officer about your problem. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: OK. I’ll talk to them. Thank you anyway. 
[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: You are welcome. ",9/8/2023 16:31
