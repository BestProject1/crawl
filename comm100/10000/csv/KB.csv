10000,How to Apply for Financial Aid,"At the University of Houston, we realize the important role financial aid plays in funding your education. In order to have access to this valuable resource in a timely fashion, it is important for you to complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as soon as possible after Oct. 1 (prior to the academic year) to ensure you receive your awards in time to pay tuition and fees. You must complete and submit the FAFSA, along with any requested documentation, by the priority deadline of Jan. 15 (prior to the academic year) to receive the maximum consideration for limited financial aid resources. The University of Houston’s Federal School Code is 003652.
Since we know the financial aid process can be confusing, staff in the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid are here to help. Financial Aid Advisors are available via email, by phone (713-743-1010, option #5), and by drop-in virtual advising (via the Navigate app) to help you with questions about your financial aid process.

1.	How to Avoid Delays
•	APPLY EARLY - The FAFSA is released Oct. 1, prior to the start of each academic year. 
 A Minute to Learn It - Applying for Financial Aid
•	UTILIZE IRS DATA RETRIEVAL (DRT) – The IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT) electronically imports your federal tax return information into your FAFSA application. Using the IRS DRT will ensure we have the most complete and accurate tax information. Make sure to have you and/or your parent’s tax return for the “prior-prior” year with you when you are filling out the FAFSA. For example, on the 2023-2024 FAFSA, you (and your parents, as appropriate) must report your 2021 income information, rather than your 2022 income information. If you are completing the 2022-2023 FAFSA, you will need to have your 2020 tax return information handy.
 What is the IRS Data Retrieval Tool?
•	PROVIDE CONSISTENT INFORMATION - A computer process scans your FAFSA and income information to ensure all information in all fields matches. Please take great consideration in providing consistent information to avoid being flagged for verification.
•	PROMPTLY SUBMIT ANY REQUESTED DOCUMENTS - The University of Houston’s Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will inform you via email if any additional documentation is required to complete your file. Make sure you are submitting the required documentation by Jan. 15 or you may miss out on priority funding.
Beginning 2023-2024, if you are selected for verification any requested documentation will be completed using our new ProVerifier+ tool found in AccessUH. Any additional requested information will be “initiated” in your myUH To-Do List and is also required to process your financial aid application. "
10000,Before You Apply,"To be eligible for Federal Financial Aid you need to:
•	Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate, or have completed homeschooling.

"
10000,Determining Your Award,"Your financial aid award(s) are determined by your cost of attendance (COA) and financial need. Need analysis, the process by which we determine your financial need, uses the information from your FAFSA and is legislated by the U.S. Congress. If the needs analysis shows that the COA is more than the amount you and your family can contribute, you will qualify for financial aid. The need analysis formula utilizes parents’ and a students’ (or student’s and spouse’s) income, assets, savings, taxes, and other mandatory living expenses to determine the expected family contribution (EFC). In addition, parents’ ages, number of dependents in the household and the dependents enrolled in college also are considered.
Determining Your Need
Costs of Attendance	$28,952
EFC	– $1,000
Total Need	$27,952
You will be notified via e-mail when you have been awarded financial aid. Accept or decline your financial aid award(s) through your myUH self-service account.
The EFC figure is not an actual amount that you (or your parents or spouse) have to pay, but it is an approximation of how much you (and your parents or spouse) should reasonably be able to contribute toward your educational expenses."
10000,Disbursement of Aid,"When we disburse your financial aid, we move your financial aid award from pending status to your balance due.

We will disburse aid for Spring 2023 based on the following schedule.

•	Professional students (Law, Medical, Optometry, Pharmacy) are on a separate disbursement schedule. Please refer any questions to your respective financial aid advisor. 
•	Loans and Scholarships will begin disbursing the first week of classes as long as you are meeting the enrollment requirements (listed below) and as long as your classes have already started. If you are enrolled in a session that starts later in the semester, your aid will not disburse until all of your sessions start and reach the Official Reporting Day (ORD).
•	All Grants will disburse after the ORD of your latest session, if you are meeting the enrollment requirements. This allows students to make changes to their enrollment status prior to the ORD without adversely affecting their financial aid status."
10000,Enrollment and Disbursement Requirements,"Students must be meeting the enrollment requirements of their awards in order for their aid to disburse in a timely fashion.
Loan Requirements:
The amount of Federal Direct Loans you receive is based on your yearly eligibility and requires at least six (undergraduate/optometry/ pharmacy/medical/law) or five (graduate) hours of enrollment for the semester to be eligible to receive any amount. A completed Entrance Counseling and a signed Master Promissory Note (MPN) with studentaid.gov is required before a Federal Direct Loan disbursement will take place. State loans may require you complete a MPN, and accept terms with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board prior to disbursement. Private/alternative loan disbursements will occur when the funds are received from your lender.
As noted on your student disclosure, changes in enrollment may result in delays, adjustments or cancellation of your pending aid. All students have been awarded based on an assumed full-time status. If you are not enrolled full time, your aid and refund may be adjusted. These adjustments will take place after ORD.
Grant Requirements:
Your grant disbursements will not occur until we have reached the Official Reporting Date (ORD) of your latest enrolled session. The delay in grant disbursement will allow you to make changes to your enrollment status without it affecting your financial aid status by the ORD period, and will reduce the risk of you owing the University money because of an over-award situation.
Type of Grant	Enrollment Requirements
Federal Pell Grant Program	Federal Pell Grant Program funds initially offered to you are based on an assumed full-time (12 hours) enrollment. The amount you will actually receive is based on the number of hours you are enrolled in, as of the 12th day of class; the information you provided on the FAFSA, and your lifetime limits already utilized. Your Federal Pell Grant Program funds will be prorated to reflect your actual enrolled hours after the 12th class day of each term.
Federal Supplemental
Educational Opportunity Grant Program (FSEOG)	FSEOG funds initially offered to you are based on at least half-time (6 hours) enrollment.  If you are enrolled between 1-5 credit hours, your FSEOG funds will be prorated to reflect your actual enrolled hours after the 12th class day of each term.
*Texas Public Education Grant	At least 9 credit hours
*TEXAS Grant	At least 9 credit hours
*Undergraduate or Graduate Tuition Grant	At least 9 credit hours for undergraduate students that began attendance at UH prior to Fall 2020. If UH attendance began on or after Fall 2020, the undergraduate requirement is at least 12 hours. All graduate students must be enrolled in at least 9 credit hours.
Other Graduate Funding 	Please visit the Graduate Funding website to view the criteria to other graduate funding options.  
*Students who have applied for graduation should complete a revision request form to our office to adjust aid before disbursement.
Please note that if you have satisfied all application and disbursement requirements and met the conditions of the award, your financial aid will be automatically credited to your UH fee bill as payment during the scheduled disbursement time. If you have financial aid remaining after your tuition has been paid, the Bursar's office, known as the Office of Student Business Services office, will forward the balance to you. For your convenience, the University of Houston utilizes BankMobile for refund processing. You must indicate your refund preference at https://www.refundselection.com/ and select how you would like to receive your funds:
•	You can elect to have your refund deposited to the bank account of your choice; or
•	You can have your refund deposited to a BankMobile Vibe account
For more information on BankMobile services, visit https://bankmobilevibe.com/.
For More Info: Disbursement FAQs.
Revisions and Cancellation of Aid
The University reserves the right to review, revise or cancel all financial aid at any time due to changes in your enrollment, financial and/or academic status or failure to comply with federal or state laws and regulations, including financial verification, audit procedures and University policies. In addition, all financial aid is subject to revision based on the funds received by the University from the federal or state government and any changes to federal or state laws, regulations or policies. This revision may occur after disbursement or after the semester has concluded.
Aid Revisions After Drop/Add Period
If your financial aid is disbursed at the beginning of the semester and you reduce your number of enrolled hours within the drop/add period, your aid will be adjusted to reflect your semester registration. If your reduced enrollment results in less eligibility for aid, you will be charged for the overpayment of financial aid — creating a balance due on your UH student account.

10000,Maintaining Financial Aid Eligibility,"The various federal and state regulations governing student financial assistance programs require that an institution develop a standard to measure students’ reasonable progress towards a degree objective – Satisfactory Academic Progress. Academic progress is reviewed at the conclusion of the academic year. Failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress will result in the denial or cancellation of your financial aid.
The following qualitative and quantitative standards MUST be met to remain eligible for aid and retain financial aid at the university. Certain programs, including the TEXAS Grant and Texas B-on-Time Loan, may have higher standards than those listed below.
Qualitative Measures of Academic Progress
The minimum cumulative UH grade point average for undergraduate students is 2.00. The minimum cumulative UH grade point average for graduate students is 3.00. When a student applies and is accepted to graduate school, the student's satisfactory academic progress will be measured according to graduate student classification.
Quantitative Measures of Academic Progress
The Financial Aid Office determines the number of hours a student must complete by the end of each enrollment period based on the student's total registered hours during Fall, Spring and Summer at UH. Summer will be considered part of the total hours of the current academic year. Students are required to complete 67% of the courses in which they enroll for that semester.
Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards
Classification	Cumulative GPA	Ratio of Passed Hours to Attempted Hours	Total Maximum Attempted Hours (Including Transfer Credits)
Undergraduate	Minimum 2.00	67%	190 Credit Hours
Graduate	Minimum 3.00	67%	100 Hours Beyond Bachelor's Degree
Law	Minimum 2.00	67%	100 Hours Beyond Bachelor's Degree
Optometry	Minimum 2.00	67%	200 Hours Beyond Bachelor's Degree
Pharmacy	Minimum 2.00	67%	100 Hours Beyond Bachelor's Degree
Post Baccalaureate	Minimum 2.00	67%	100 Hours Beyond First Bachelor's Degree
NOTE: Hours passed DO NOT include grades of: I (incomplete), U (unsatisfactory), F (failed); Q or W (withdrawal); however, these hours are included in hours attempted. Courses that have been repeated will be counted for each enrollment as hours attempted and will be counted as hours completed if a grade other than I, U, Q, or W is received.
Ratio is determined by dividing the cumulative number of credits you have earned by the cumulative number of credits you have attempted.

Number of Passed Hours ÷ Attempted Hours = Ratio
Repeat Course Policy for Financial Aid 
Federal policy states that a student may receive federal financial aid for a repeated course only once if the course was previously passed (credit was received). You can read the form here for a complete explanation of the policy.
Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Process
If extenuating circumstances exist, you may initiate an appeal through our office. The satisfactory academic progress appeal form, requirements, and deadlines are available on the Financial Aid & Scholarship Forms page.
Unusual Enrollment History
Certain students that complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) will be flagged for “unusual enrollment history” (UEH) by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of students having received Federal Pell Grant Program funds at multiple institutions in recent years. These flags (flags “2” and “3”) will be indicated on the FAFSA Student Aid Report (SAR). 
The University of Houston’s Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will be required to review UEH flags and check the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) for complete enrollment history (i.e., name of each school attended during the previous four academic years). They will then determine if a student had a valid reason for having unusual enrollment at multiple institutions or if the student was only enrolled long enough to receive cash refunds of federal student aid.
NOTE: Unusual Enrollment History (UEH) must be resolved before you can receive federal financial aid.
How to Resolve
All students with UEH flag 3 and some students with UEH flag 2 will be required to provide the University of Houston their academic transcripts from all colleges and universities attended during the review period. If Federal Pell Grant Program funds were received and credit hours (passing grades:  A-D) were not earned at each institution attended during these award years, the student may be determined ineligible for further federal financial aid. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid has the authority to request official academic transcripts from any/all colleges attended during the review period, if the documents you submit are unclear.
If your Student Aid Report (SAR) includes UEH flag 3, please complete the Unusual Enrollment History form and submit it to the University of Houston's Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid along with all required documentation.
If your SAR includes UEH flag 2, the university will notify you if you will be required to complete the Unusual Enrollment History Review form.
Appealing the Ineligibility Determination
If a student has been determined by the university as ineligible for federal student aid, he/she may appeal the determination by completing the Unusual Enrollment History Appeal form.
Regaining Federal Student Aid Eligibility
 Students whose aid eligibility is denied as a result of their UEH may be re-considered for federal student aid. In order to regain eligibility a student must complete all attempted courses according to their academic plan, in one semester of full-time enrollment or two semesters of at least half-time enrollment. Students cannot drop or withdraw (officially or unofficially) from any courses after the term begins, and must meet the university’s standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). If eligibility has been lost, a student cannot receive financial aid. Also, aid cannot retroactively be reinstated.
Annual, Aggregate, and Lifetime Limits, and Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements
Federal Pell Grant Program funds may only be received for up to twelve (12) full-time semesters.  (Federal Pell Grant Program funds received for part-time attendance are pro-rated against the 12 full-time semesters.)  
There are annual and aggregate borrowing limits on Federal Direct Loans, and these loans can be borrowed only up 150% of the published length of the student’s academic program. 
All financial aid programs are subject to Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements, which measure students’ progress toward program completion."
10000,Satisfactory Academic Progress,"UH WILL CALCULATE SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) FOR THE STUDENT AFTER A FAFSA OR TASFA APPLICATION IS SUBMITTED.
The Department of Education's regulations governing student financial assistance require that an institution develop standards to measure academic progress toward a degree. Students applying for financial aid will be monitored for satisfactory academic progress whether or not financial aid was applied for or received during any academic period in which the student was previously enrolled. A student will not be eligible for financial assistance (including Federal Direct Loans) if he/she does not meet the academic progress requirements. Minimum standards, including qualitative and quantitative measures of progress, must be achieved by the end of any given enrollment period at the University of Houston.
Students are required to complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and a SAP appeal form by established deadline dates (review Section 19 of the policy for these dates). Failure to complete a FAFSA before the first day of the term or submit a SAP appeal by the printed deadline will result in loss of appeal submission opportunity.

Qualitative Requirements of Satisfactory Academic Progress
Grade Point Average (GPA) – Undergraduate, Law, Optometry, Pharmacy or Graduate Architecture students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA. All other graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
Quantitative Requirements of Satisfactory Academic Progress
Percentage of attempted cumulative hours completed – Complete and pass a minimum of 67percent of the hours attempted at the University of Houston.
Maximum Timeframe
Federal regulations require that a student complete his program of study within 150 percent (length of program x 1.5) of the time allotted for the program. For example, if an undergraduate degree is 120 credit hours in length, a student with this major must complete the program within 180 (120 x 1.5) credit hours. All credit hours attempted at the University of Houston, including repeated courses with a grade of “F”, “W”, “I”, or “IP”, and all transfer hours to be used toward a degree at the University of Houston that were pursued at a previous institution, will be counted in the determination of hours attempted. After attempting 180 credit hours, the student‘s financial aid eligibility will be terminated for this program.
Students Who Receive All Failing Grades
If a student does not receive a passing grade in any class (earning any combination of ""F""s, ""W""s and ""U""s), or stops attending classes without notifying the University during a semester in which he/she received financial aid, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (SFA) must return all or a portion of aid that was disbursed. Official documentation proving that the student participated in an academically related event during the semester will be requested in order to show that the student earned Title IV aid. A calculation of earned aid will be processed based on acceptable documentation. If no acceptable documentation is provided, 100 percent of aid will be returned. Any return of funds will result in the student owing a balance to the University.
Possible Categories Assigned after SAP is calculated:
Meets SAP
A status assigned to a student who has met minimum SAP requirements.

Not Meets
A status of “Not Meets” is assigned to a student who is currently not meeting SAP federal standards for any of the following categories – cumulative completion ratio, cumulative GPA, and not exceeding 150 percent of hours needed to complete the program. Students who have a semester of all F, W's, NR's for their only grades and I's will impact their completion ratio for the following SAP evaluation period.
Students not meeting SAP will be placed on financial aid suspension and are not eligible to receive further funding. Students have the right to appeal their suspension by submitting a SAP Appeal form with supporting documentation to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by the printed deadline. Students whose appeals are approved must make academic progress and return to SAP good standing within one probationary term. Students who do not meet the requirements will have all further financial aid suspended until they do.
Appeal Process
Students who are placed on financial aid suspension may submit an appeal to reinstate eligibility. An appeal must be submitted to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (SFA) before aid can be disbursed in future semesters. Appeals must be completed by the student. A personal statement and corroborating documents as listed on the second page of the SAP form MUST be submitted in order to be considered as a complete submission . A student can submit the appeal and mandatory additional documents in person at the Financial Aid Counter in Welcome Center, Room 120, by fax at (713) 743-9098, or by upload feature. We encourage students to submit their completed SAP appeal online using the upload feature within the To-Do List (PDF format only) by 5 p.m. on the deadline date listed on the appeal form. Students may also be required to complete a SAP Academic Plan for future semesters.
If submitted appeal documents are incomplete or lack corroborating documents, your review and decision process could be delayed or denied. Regardless of method of submission, please make sure that the myUH ID number is on the top right-hand corner of every page. The appeal forms are available in the Forms section of this website as well as in the Welcome Center office. Please follow the deadlines as listed on the SAP appeal form. If the student's appeal is denied, he/she will be responsible for covering the balance for that semester. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will provide an initial review and response to the student's appeal before the University payment due date if the student submits a complete appeal and all supporting documents by the priority deadline.
Tips for Submitting the SAP Form


1. Read your Financial Aid To-Do List descriptions and the SAP form thoroughly. Please be sure to check off and sign where required. Incomplete forms will be denied.

2. Please put in effort toward answering the questions for your personal statement (Section II of the SAP form) and be sure to include documentation to support your statement. For example, if Adam performed poorly in the fall due to excessive work hours, Adam should discuss this situation in his personal statement, and include a copy of his work schedule from that time. If Adam has now prioritized his academics and made adjustments to reduce his work hours, Adam can also include a copy of his new work schedule to demonstrate the adjustment.

3. We encourage students to combine their appeal and corroborating documents into one PDF file and upload it to their To-Do List to save time waiting in line. However, please consider that submitting the forms at our Financial Aid counter in the Welcome Center will allow for an initial review by an advisor, who can then counsel you on any incomplete portions of the appeal. This review process is not available online if you upload your file.
Process For Those Who Have Already Been Denied
If a student fails to meet SAP standards despite prior SAP approvals or academic plans, and consequently loses financial aid eligibility, the student may submit a written appeal with supporting documentation for reinstatement of financial aid eligibility, only if mitigating circumstances exist.

Mitigating circumstances include:
• Serious injury of the student and/or the student's immediate family
• Serious extended illness of the student and/or the student's immediate family
• Death of student's relative
Appeal Process For Not Meets Status
Students who are placed on financial aid suspension may appeal to re-establish eligibility.
•	Academic Suspension – Academic suspension is determined by the Office of the University Registrar. Students may not appeal for financial aid until the academic suspension is lifted. An approval on an academic appeal does not automatically mean the student will be granted approval on a financial aid appeal.  
•	A student not meeting SAP standards must submit a Financial Aid Appeal Form with supporting documentation to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by the printed deadline in order to receive consideration for financial aid eligibility. Failure to provide supporting documentation will result in the denial of an appeal. Students appealing their suspension must pay their own expenses until the appeal is reviewed. After an appeal has been reviewed and has been denied, the student must continue to pay his/her own expenses.
•	Students who submit their SAP appeal by the priority deadline as noted on the SAP form will receive a decision on their appeal before the University payment due date. Students who submit their appeal after the priority deadline and before or on the final deadline will have their appeal reviewed within four weeks of its receipt and determine whether the financial aid suspension is justified . Students will be notified of appeal decision via the destination email address, as noted in the myUH self-service center.
The Financial Aid SAP Appeal Form is available on our SFA forms webpage. Appeals can be uploaded online, faxed to our office at (713) 743-9098 or dropped off to our SFA counter in the Welcome Center."
10000,Special Circumstances,"Federal, state and institutional regulations govern the administration of financial aid programs. Your eligibility is calculated based on all information submitted on your FAFSA. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid recognizes that many families experience changes in income or have family situations that are not reflected correctly on the FAFSA. Under federal guidance, we can revise your FAFSA information to reflect your circumstances more accurately.
Dependency Status
Financial Reconsideration
Dependency Status
Are You Independent? Eligibility for financial aid is based on the premise that your family has the primary responsibility to pay for your education. There are specific guidelines for determining whether you are a dependent or independent student. This is different from your dependency status for tax purposes. To be considered an independent student, you have to be able to answer “yes” to at least one of the following questions (and provide documentation if requested):
1.	Are you 24 years old or older?
2.	As of today, are you married? (Also answer ""yes"" if you are separated but not divorced.)
3.	Will you be working on a master's or doctorate program (such as an M.A., M.B.A., M.D., J.D., Ph.D., Ed.D., graduate certificate, etc.)?
4.	Are you currently serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces for purposes other than training?
5.	Are you a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces?
6.	Do you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you?
7.	Do you have dependents (other than your children or spouse) who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you?
8.	At any time since you turned age 13, were both your parents deceased, were you in foster care or were you a dependent or ward of the court?
9.	As determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you an emancipated minor?
10.	As determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you in legal guardianship?
11.	In the past year, did your high school or school district homeless liaison determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?
12.	In the past year, did the director of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?
13.	In the past year, did the director of a runaway or homeless youth basic center or transitional living program determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless or were self-supporting and at risk of being homeless?
If you cannot answer “yes” to any of the above, then you are considered a dependent student and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) will require your parent(s) information in addition to your own.
Without your parent(s) information, you may still be eligible to receive $2,750 to $3,750 per semester (based on grade level) in a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. You will not be eligible for other federal, state or university need-based aid. Your parent(s) must certify their refusal to provide you with financial support and provide the information requested on the FAFSA. To begin this process, submit a FAFSA with your information only and then reach out to a financial aid advisor to discuss next steps. 
If you have documentable, unusual or extenuating circumstances that affect your family situation, please visit the Welcome Center to consult with a financial aid advisor about a possible dependency override. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, an abusive family environment or abandonment by parents.
The following are not considered unusual or extenuating family circumstances:
•	You do not live in your parents' home
•	You are self-supporting
•	You are not claimed as a federal income tax exemption on your parents' income tax return
•	Your parents cannot afford or refuse to help with college or living expenses
•	Your parents are unwilling to provide their financial information to complete the FAFSA
•	You and your parents had disagreements resulting in a breakdown in your relationship
The financial aid advisor will provide you with further instructions if your circumstances warrant an appeal. Prior to visiting, please gather documentation that supports your circumstances. Your FAFSA information also will be subject to federal verification.
All information will be considered confidential and protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Official communications regarding the appeal decision will be sent via email to the address on file within university records.
Financial Reconsideration
If you or your family recently experienced unique, documentable circumstances that affect your ability to contribute toward your educational expenses, your circumstances may warrant a financial reconsideration appeal.
Please contact your financial aid advisor about a financial reconsideration appeal. To find your advisor, please click here.
All financial reconsideration appeals will be processed in the order received, in accordance with Federal, State and institutional program guidelines and awarding limits.
Possible outcomes:
1. Reduce your Expected Financial Contribution (EFC).
If your appeal results in a reduced EFC, your eligibility increases for the following federal programs:
•	Federal Direct Subsidized Loan (maximum $1,750 to $2,750 per semester, depending on grade level)
•	Federal Pell Grant Program (In 2019−2020 the maximum was $6,195 per semester for 12 hours of enrollment)
2. Increase your Cost of Attendance (COA).
Your COA can be increased for federally allowable, out-of-pocket expenses, child-care or unusual medical expenses. More information about COA can be found here.
Special circumstances may include, but are not limited to:
•	Loss of employment or income
•	Sudden disability or illness
•	Separation or divorce
•	Death
•	Other catastrophic events
•	Out-of-pocket payments made toward unusual medical/dental expenses
The following lifestyle choices are not considered special circumstances, and financial reconsideration cannot be made:
•	Student or parent credit card debt
•	Mortgage or car payments
•	Early retirement (before age 65)
•	Elective cosmetic surgery
•	Elective housing choices
•	Receipt of cash settlements, inheritance, 401k or other taxable income that is used to pay other sources of debt
•	Other one-time taxable income that is reported on the tax return (i.e., lottery winnings, one-time payments, etc.)
The financial aid advisor will provide you with further instructions if your circumstances warrant an appeal. Prior to contacting them, please gather documentation that supports your circumstances. Your current FAFSA information also will be subject to federal verification.
All information will be considered confidential and protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Appeal requests are reviewed in the order received and processed based on fund availability. Official communications regarding the appeal decision will be sent via email to the destination email address on file within university records.
Please contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid with any questions."
10000,Withdrawal Policy,"For any student who officially or unofficially withdraws from the university or fails to earn a passing grade in any class, federal regulations require a refund calculation for all students receiving Federal Title IV Funds. The calculation of the return of those funds may result in your owning a balance to the university. Also any future aid will be canceled. For any withdrawal prior to the 12th class day, all state and institutional aid will be canceled. Withdrawing from classes will also impact your Satisfactory Academic Progress standing and may cause you to become ineligible for future financial aid. Any changes to your enrollment should be discussed with a financial aid advisor.
Return to Title IV Funds
Federal regulations require a refund calculation for all students receiving Federal Title IV Funds who officially or unofficially withdraw from the university.
If you officially withdraw, the length of time during which a refund must be calculated is up to 60 percent of the payment period (semester). If a student withdraws or cancels enrollment on or before the 60 percent point in time, all or a portion of Title IV Funds (Federal Pell Grant Program, Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant Program, Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Program, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program, and Federal PLUS Loans) awarded to a student have to be returned according to provisions of the Higher Educational Act Amendment of 1998. Also, any future aid will be canceled.
If you unofficially withdraw, or stop attending classes without notifying the University, or if you do not earn a passing grade in any class during a semester in which you received financial aid, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid must return all or a portion of aid that was disbursed. If you do not earn a passing grade in any class, the Office Scholarships and Financial Aid will email your professors a request to provide a last date of attendance. The last date of attendance will prove that you participated in an academically related event during the semester in order to show that you earned Title IV aid. A calculation of earned aid will be processed based on the date your professors provide. If a last date of attendance is not provided, 100 percent of aid will be returned. Any return of funds will result in you owing a balance to the University."
10000,Fraud Policy/Code of Ethics,"Federal regulations (34 CFR 668.16(g) require a school to refer to the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) any credible information indicating that an applicant for Federal Student aid may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her application. Commonly falsified items include false claims of independent student status, false claims of citizenship, use of false identities, forgery of signatures of certifications, and false statements of income.
If such intent is suspected on the part of a student, employee or third-party servicer, the case will be referred to the University of Houston's legal council immediately for initial investigation, followed by a formal report made to the OIG.  You may be fined up to $20,000, sent to prison, or both."
10000,Verification of Information,"Meet ProVerifier+
The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid is excited to introduce our new automated verification solution called ProVerifier+ powered by ProEducation Solutions. If your FAFSA is selected for verification, you will receive an introductory email to your preferred UH email address. This new tool enables you to complete verification documents from your smart phone, tablet or computer - even signing electronically! The tool is located within your AccessUH account. Just look for the ProVerifier+ icon (pictured).
 
  
 
We will begin using ProVerifier+ for verification with the 2023-2024 FAFSA.
 
Upon receipt of all required documents, the automated verification process will begin. Students will be notified via email or text if there are any questions or if any additional documentation is required.
 
Questions? Call ProVerifier+ at 713-748-3249. The ProVerifier+ call center is open from 7:00AM to 6:30PM.   
Verification is a random quality-control method used by the U.S. Department of Education to check the accuracy of information submitted on the FAFSA. All schools that disburse federal Title IV funds are required to participate in the verification process. The verification process is a manual review of your application and requires additional documentation and additional processing time.
Review a list of ways to reduce your chances of being selected for verification on the How to Apply for Financial Aid page.
Students Selected for Verification
If you are selected for verification, you will be notified via email informing you of any additional documentation required or any changes to your award due to verification.
Beginning 2023-2024, any requested documentation will be completed using our ProVerifier+ tool found in AccessUH. Any additional requested information will be “initiated” in your myUH To-Do List and is also required to process your financial aid application.
Failure to submit the requested documents will prevent awarding or result in the cancellation of existing financial aid awards. If any differences are found between information reported on the FAFSA and actual figures reported on verification documents, corrections will be made to your FAFSA and adjustments may be made to your financial aid package.
Note: When referring to your myUH To-Do List, be sure to select the correct award year for financial aid information:
•	2023 aid year includes Fall 2022, Spring 2023 and Summer 2023 terms

10000,TASFA/Senate Bill 1528,"(Formerly House Bill 1403)
Certain unauthorized immigrants are eligible to enroll in Texas public colleges and pay in-state tuition. In 2001, the Texas Legislature passed a bill that states that these students may be eligible for state grants. Eligible students MUST meet certain criteria provided in the legislation to be considered for Senate Bill 1528 status.
Students who are not U.S. Citizens, U.S. legal permanent residents, or eligible noncitizens do not qualify for federal financial assistance to pay for college.
Under HB 1403/SB1528 students are eligible to receive a variety of forms of state financial aid, but first must submit the University of Houston's electronic Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA).
As of Oct. 1, 2022, students can submit an electronic 23-24 TASFA by utilizing the University of Houston’s eTASFA portal.

Students and/or their parents must provide important information about their family's income and expenses every year. The University of Houston will use this application to determine how much state financial aid the student is eligible for. Please note that availability of funds is very limited, submitting an application does not guarantee eligibility. Students are encouraged to complete the application and upload all requested documentation by the Jan. 15 priority deadline each year to be considered for maximum funding.

•	Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Before you Apply
To be eligible to apply for state financial aid you must meet the following criteria:
•	You must not be eligible to apply for federal aid through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
•	Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate
•	Be classified as a Texas resident (Note that a nonresident who pays a resident rate due to a tuition waiver is not a resident for the purpose of this application)
•	Be enrolled for a minimum of nine hours in a degree-seeking program
•	Be registered with the Selective Service if required (males only)
•	Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress
•	Submit a Residency Affidavit to the Office of the University Registrar. *(Please note: This form is for admitted students only. If you have not graduated high school, your submitted form will stay in pending status until your final high school transcript is received by the Admissions Office. We encourage you to fill out the TASFA even if your Residency Affidavit is pending.)
Once you have determined that you are eligible, you are ready to begin the six steps to apply for state financial aid.
Steps for State Applicants
Step 1: File Taxes
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires you (and your spouse) and/or your parents to file a tax return if either you (or your spouse) and/or your parents meet the income thresholds established annually by the IRS. For more information regarding income thresholds, go to www.irs.gov. Request an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN): Individuals who do not have a Social Security Number can apply for an ITIN using a W-7 Tax Form. For more information, go to www.irs.gov.
Step 2: Register with the Selective Service (males only)
If you are a male between the ages of 18 and 25, you must register with the Selective Service. You can obtain a registration form at your local post office or at sss.gov/forms.
Step 3: Complete your TASFA
Submit the e-TASFA by clicking here. If you have not used the e-TASFA portal before, you will need to create an account to be able to submit your electronic application. If you previously created an account, you can sign in using the same credentials. Once you have completed and submitted the online application, you will be notified via email to submit any additional documents, which may include tax transcripts, selective service registration, and/or additional forms. You will also see the required documents listed in your myUH self-service To-Do List. These documents should be submitted by uploading them to each To-Do List item. Please click here for instructions on how to upload documents.
Additional documents requested may include one or more of the following:
•	Proof of registration with Selective Service (males only). You may upload a copy of the registration acknowledgement card.
•	A copy of your income tax transcript(s) for the requested year. If you (and your spouse) and/or your parents are required to file taxes, we will not process your TASFA until you upload a copy of all tax returns or IRS tax transcripts. If income was earned but a tax return was not submitted, please upload all W-2s for the requested tax year.
•	Order a free copy of tax return transcript. To order one, go to www.irs.gov or call 1-800-908-9946.
•	You must complete and submit the TASFA to our office and upload any additional documents requested by the priority deadline of Jan. 15, to receive the maximum consideration for limited financial aid resources.
Step 4: Complete Your File if additional documentation is required
This program is awarded according to availability of funds. Applicants are awarded in order that they submit and/or complete their applications.
While processing your TASFA, additional documentation may be requested to complete your application. You will be notified via email if your file is incomplete. Be sure you monitor your To-Do List online in your myUH self-service account. The priority deadline to submit all requested documents is Jan. 15.
If we have requested additional documents, your completion date will be the date on which you submitted the last required document.
For example: Scott submits his TASFA in November but has required, initiated To Do List items that were requested in December. He uploads his parents' tax return transcript and all other required documents in December, but does not upload a copy of his Selective Service Registration Card until March. In this example, he would not be considered complete until March, at which time his file would be updated and submitted for review, but only after submitting all necessary documents.
In certain cases, we may initiate required documents via your To Do List after the Jan. 15 priority deadline, if you submitted your initial application by Jan. 15 and you did not have any pending items at that time, you will still be considered for priority funding. However, you must submit any required documents as soon as possible to complete your file to be offered any state aid.
Step 5: Check Your Status
In order to be eligible for state assistance, you MUST be a fully admitted, degree-seeking student. Check your status online in your myUH self-service account.
Step 6: Accept Your Awards
We will notify you via email when you have been awarded financial aid. Accept or decline your state financial award(s) in your myUH self-service account. Please refer to our Disbursement of Aid website for more information.
For help filling out your TASFA form:
•	Most high schools offer financial aid information sessions for students and parents
•	Video guides (available in English and Spanish) from AIE.org
The University of Houston strives to make the TASFA process as straightforward as possible, but some students have unique situations that they need help with. If you still have questions, our financial aid advisors are available to answer your questions at the Welcome Center or by phone at 713-743-1010, option 5.
Types of State Aid
Texas Public Educational Grant (TPEG) - This program, administered by the state of Texas, provides assistance to students with financial need who are seeking a first Bachelor's degree. Only Texas residents and nonresidents who meet the priority deadline of Jan. 15 are considered.

10000,Undergraduate Course Fees,"The University of Houston System Board of Regents may have authorized fees associated with specific courses. Students should check the class listings to determine if additional charges are associated with course offerings. The fees can either be a flat fee or a per hour fee (course fee x number of credit hours).
Any course which is either repeated for the third time or more; or any course which exceeds the undergraduate total course cap will be charged an additional $171/credit hour."
10000,Types of Aid,"The University of Houston offers several different kinds of financial assistance, ranging from scholarships that are awarded on the basis of academic merit to loans awarded on the basis of financial need. A typical financial aid package includes more than one type of aid.
The types of aid available at UH are:
Scholarships
Merit-based awards that you do not have to repay
Scholarships
Grants
Need-based awards that you do not have to repay
Grant Programs
 
State of Texas Financial Aid Programs
Loans
Need-based, federally funded loans that you repay at below-market interest rates, plus private bank loans if you don’t qualify for Federal Direct Loans
Loan Programs
Work-Study

What is Federal Work-Study?
Financial Incentives
Financial incentives are special programs available at the University of Houston that help students balance course hours and the cost of tuition over time while still encouraging them to make the most of their educational experience.
Summer Aid
Available if you are enrolled at least half-time and have remaining aid that was NOT used during the fall and spring semesters.
Spring Aid
Available if you are enrolled at least half-time and have remaining aid that was NOT used during the fall semester."
10000,Cougar Emergency Fund,"The Cougar Emergency Fund is a grant administered through the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (SFA), established through the generous gifts of alumni and friends of the University of Houston. It provides current degree-seeking students with assistance when an imminent, extraordinary need is identified, and when students find themselves dealing with a personal or family emergency which creates uncertainty in being able to meet the costs associated with attending school. 
While it is not intended to cover expenses that could have been anticipated prior to the start of the term (like tuition, fees, housing, etc.); the Fund is intended to assist students who experience unexpected crises that arise during the current semester. 
•	Examples of unexpected crises may include: 
o	mechanical issues with transportation preventing a student from attending classes 
o	unexpected medical bills not covered by insurance 
o	travel expenses to attend a funeral for an immediate family member 
o	natural disaster-related costs due to lost books or transportation to school 
o	a recent, involuntary job loss lasting more than four weeks 
•	Students are expected to borrow their full student loan eligibility prior to receiving funding from the CEF.
•	The Cougar Emergency Fund may not be used for optional expenses.
•	Detailed receipts are necessary for all grant approvals.
•	Funds are available to currently enrolled undergraduate or graduate students, with priority going to students enrolled full-time (12 hours for undergraduates, 9 hours for graduate students). Students must be in both academic and disciplinary good standing as defined by university policies and procedures. Citizenship and permanent resident status are not requirements; all students are eligible to apply.
•	U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens are asked to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the current academic year to allow the University to connect students with every type of funding available, maximizing how we can assist them financially.
•	The award amount for those completing the application is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the student’s expenses, and is capped at $1,500. Funds will be paid to the student through direct disbursement either through a designated bank account or issuance of a check. Students are encouraged to make sure they have stablished a refund preference is or update their refund preference to receive funds electronically as paper checks can take up to 10 days to be issued.
•	Funding is limited, if funds are exhausted at the time a completed application is received, we will be unable to provide assistance.
Application and Award Process
The student may contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (SFA) to request a Cougar Emergency Fund application by calling (713) 743-1010, option 5. If the student's circumstances appear to be appropriate for grant approval, the form will be loaded to the student's myUH To Do List.  The student must complete the form and upload it, along with all indicated supporting documentation, to their myUH account. Failure to submit a completed form, including supporting documentation, will result in the assistance being denied.
•	For U.S. citizens and permanent residents, SFA will determine the student’s eligibility for federal, state and other institutional funds, prior to offering Cougar Emergency Fund. SFA will also coordinate Cougar Emergency Fund with the student’s other financial aid.
•	The decision will be emailed to the student by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid and eligible assistance will be viewable through the student’s myUH account.
•	Cougar Emergency Funds will be credited to the student’s account. Students who have balances due to the University may still be eligible to have these funds refunded directly to them, according to their established refund preference at RefundSelection.com."
10000,COVID-19 Financial Aid,"All COVID-19 related funding was expended during the 19-20, 20-21 and 21-22 academic years.  No COVID-19-related emergency funding is anticipated for the 22-23 academic year.
The University of Houston has been providing emergency grant funding to assist students whose households have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds were provided by the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF III) through the American Rescue Plan (ARP).
NOTICE: The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid does not employ tax experts and by law cannot answer specific tax questions or help students prepare tax forms. It is the student’s responsibility to meet their tax obligations. We offer this FAQ from the IRS to guide students as they discuss these matters with tax preparers.
Important information:
•	Grants are available to degree-seeking students whose households were impacted by COVID-19 anytime since March 13, 2020 and have been enrolled at the University of Houston since March 13, 2020, with preference given to currently enrolled students.
•	Students must document losses or expenses specifically related to COVID-19 as funds can only be awarded with documentation.
•	Processing times may take up to six weeks.
Grant Maximum Increased
Effective January 20, the maximum allowable grant from HEERF III funding has been increased to $10,000 for the 2021-22 academic year. The previous maximum had been $6,495.  
Students who previously submitted applications which were awarded the old maximum of $6,495 will automatically be reviewed for additional eligibility in the order in which they were received.  Reprocessing of prior applications may take six to eight weeks.  
•	If the documentation previously submitted supports an increase in funding, it will automatically be applied to your account, up to a total of $10,000.    
•	If the documentation previously submitted only supports a smaller increase, that amount will be awarded, and the student will have a new application added to their To Do List to submit an additional application and documentation in support of the total maximum grant amount of $10,000.  
Students who previously submitted applications which were awarded less than the old maximum, will have a new application added to their To Do List to submit an additional application and documentation in support of the total maximum grant amount of $10,000."
10000,University Funded Merit Scholarships,"The University funds several academically-competitive scholarships for incoming freshmen. In order to be considered for a university-funded scholarship, you must meet the following criteria:
•	Apply for admission to UH for the fall semester immediately following high school graduation.
•	Complete your application for admission, including the submission of all supporting documentation (application, application fee, official transcripts, and test scores), by the priority date.
University-funded scholarships for incoming freshmen include:
2022-2023 Academic Excellence Scholarship
Academic Excellence Scholarship priority deadlines have passed and the awarding for freshman entering in fall 2022 has concluded. The profile of the incoming freshman class varies from year to year.

Tier One Scholarship
Fall 2022:  To learn more about the Tier One Scholarship and the selection process, please visit the Tier One Scholars website.
Award Maximums
Any scholarship counts as a financial resource and must be considered when constructing a financial aid award package. A student’s total financial aid cannot exceed the cost of attendance (COA). COA is an estimate of what it costs the typical student to attend the University of Houston. Your COA includes tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation and personal expenses. Exceptions are made for Federal Pell Grant Program recipients, whose financial aid packages can add up to the COA plus the amount of the Federal Pell Grant Program funds. Awards from the University of Houston are subject to change depending on the entire student award package and the student's COA.
Scholarship Renewal Requirements
Academic Excellence, National Merit, Tier One, and Cullen Leadership Scholarships will renew each year (up to 8 undergraduate semesters, or 10 semesters for architecture students) provided you meet the requirements listed below. These requirements went into effect during the 2018-19 academic year and apply only to students receiving one of the university funded merit scholarships as of Fall 2018 or later.

•	Enroll in 12 credit hours at UH each fall and spring semester. Your scholarship funds will not credit to your account if you are enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours.
•	Maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The GPA calculation only includes courses taken at UH.

•	Complete and pass a total of 30 credit hours by the end of the summer following your first year at UH, 60 hours by the end of the second year, and 90 hours by the end of the third year. Transfer, AP, and dual credit hours will count toward this requirement.
•	Additional details to note:

o	Transfer hours may be counted toward your total credit hours completed, but they do not count toward your cumulative GPA.
o	Credit hours for repeated courses do not count toward the credit hour requirements. If you have AP or dual credit for a course and you take the course at UH, it is considered a repeat course and will not count toward your credit hour requirements. Your advisor can help you remove AP credit if necessary.
o	Courses completed with grades of I, U, W or F are not counted toward the credit hour requirements.
o	Summer courses taken at UH will count toward your credit hours and GPA requirements, but tuition and fees for those courses will not be funded by the scholarship. The University strongly recommends completing your scholarship requirements during the fall and spring semesters."

The amount of the loan origination fee for a loan is determined by the date of the first disbursement of the loan. Any subsequent disbursements, even if made on or after the relevant Oct. 1, have the same loan fee percentage that applied to the first disbursement of that loan. Please click here for more information about loan fees.
For latest announcements regarding the federal student aid programs, please visit the Federal Student Aid website.
 
Loan Amount
There are no set limits for Federal Direct PLUS Loans, but a parent may not borrow more than the cost of their child's education minus any other financial aid received, such as a Federal Direct Subsidized or Federal Unsubsidized Loan. We will determine the actual amount you may borrow.
The interest rate for Federal Direct PLUS Loans is fixed. Interest is charged on Federal Direct PLUS Loans during all periods, beginning on the date of your loan's first disbursement. To find out more information on interest rates for Federal Direct PLUS Loans, please click here.
In addition to interest, you pay a loan origination fee that is a percentage of the principal amount of each Federal Direct PLUS Loan that you receive. This fee helps reduce the cost of making these low-interest loans. We deduct the fee before you receive any loan money, so the loan amount you actually receive will be less than the amount you have to repay.
Dependent students whose parents have applied for but were unable to get a PLUS Loan are eligible to receive additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.
Application for Loans
Eligibility Requirements

Student/Child must,
•	be a dependent undergraduate student;
•	be enrolled in at least half-time with established financial need;
•	be enrolled in an undergraduate degree program (certification programs are not eligible for financial aid);
•	have completed a FAFSA and be eligible to receive federal financial aid.
To take out a Federal PLUS Loan for the first time, the parent must complete a Federal PLUS Loan Application and master promissory note (MPN) online at the StudentAid.gov website. The MPN is a legal document in which you promise to repay your loan(s) and any accrued interest and fees to the Department. It also explains the terms and conditions of your loan(s).
A parent may complete the MPN electronically, you can do so online at the StudentAid.gov website. If you are borrowing Federal Direct PLUS Loans for more than one student, you'll need to complete a separate MPN for each one. To complete an MPN online, you will be required to use your Department of Education-issued FSA ID (not your child's). If you do not have a FSA ID, you may request one from the official FSA ID site.
In most cases, once you've submitted the MPN and it's been accepted, you won't have to fill out a new MPN for future loans you receive to pay for the educational expenses of the same student. You can borrow additional Federal PLUS Loans on a single MPN for up to 10 years at the same school.
You'll receive a disclosure statement that gives you specific information about any loan that the school plans to disburse under your MPN, including the loan amount and loan fees, and the expected loan disbursement dates and amounts.
Credit Check & Endorser Alternative
To be eligible for a Federal PLUS Loan, the parent must not have an adverse credit history, which the Department of Education will check for when you apply for the loan. If you are found to have an adverse credit history, you may still borrow a Federal PLUS Loan if you get an endorser who does not have such a history. An endorser is someone who agrees to repay the loan if you do not. The endorser may not be the student on whose behalf a parent obtains a Federal PLUS Loan. In some cases you may also be able to obtain a Federal PLUS Loan if you document to our satisfaction that there are extenuating circumstances related to your adverse credit history.
In addition, parents and their dependent child must be U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens, must not be in default on any federal education loans or owe an overpayment on a federal education grant, and must meet other general eligibility requirements for the Federal Student Aid programs. You can find more information about these requirements he Federal Student Aid website.
Disbursement of Loans
Once the Federal PLUS loan application has been processed by our office and MPN received, disbursement will begin during the first week of classes. When funds have been disbursed, they will be applied to the student's account to cover charges. If a credit balance is created, funds will be refunded to the student's refund preference.
Maintenance of Loans
In order to maintain eligibility, students must be enrolled at least half-time at the time of disbursement and meet all Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements.
Repayment of Loans
There is no grace period for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan — the repayment period begins 60 days after your school makes the last disbursement of the loan. However, if you're a parent Federal PLUS Loan borrower who is also a student, you can defer repayment while you're enrolled in school at least half time and (for Federal Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008) for an additional 6 months after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment.
If you're a parent Federal PLUS Loan borrower, you can defer repayment of Federal Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, while the student for whom you obtained the loan is enrolled at least half time, and for an additional 6 months after the student graduates or drops below half-time enrollment (half-time enrollment status is determined by your child's school). You must separately request each deferment period.
Generally, you'll have from 10 to 25 years to repay your loan, depending on the repayment plan that you choose. You can choose to repay your Federal PLUS Loan using the standard, extended, or graduated repayment plan. Read more about these repayment plans.
Your loan servicer will notify you of the date your first payment is due. If you do not choose a repayment plan, your loan servicer will place you on the standard plan, with fixed monthly payments for up to 10 years. Most Federal Direct Loan borrowers choose to stay with the standard repayment plan, but there are other options for borrowers who may need more time to repay or who need to make lower payments at the beginning of the repayment period.
You can change repayment plans at any time by contacting your loan servicer.
Consolidation
If you have multiple federal education loans, you can consolidate them into a single Direct Consolidation Loan. This may simplify repayment if you are currently making separate loan payments to different loan holders, as you'll only have one monthly payment to make. There may be tradeoffs, however, so you'll want to learn about the advantages and possible disadvantages of consolidation before you consolidate. To learn more, visit the Direct Consolidation Loan website.
Automated payments (electronic debit)
When you receive your first bill, you'll learn how to sign up for the electronic debit account (EDA) option and have your bank automatically make your monthly loan payments for you from your checking or savings account. You won't have to write checks, use stamps, or worry if your payment will get to us by the due date. In addition, there is a 0.25 percent reduction in the interest rate on your loans during any period when your payments are made through EDA.
Trouble making payments
If you're having trouble making payments on your loans, contact your loan servicer as soon as possible. Their staff will work with you to determine the best option for you. Options include:
•	Changing repayment plans.
•	Deferment, if you meet certain requirements. A deferment allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan.
•	Forbearance, if you don't meet the eligibility requirements for a deferment, but are temporarily unable to make your loan payments. A forbearance allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan, temporarily make smaller payments, or extend the time for making payments. Read more about deferments and forbearance.
If you stop making payments and don't get a deferment or forbearance, your loan could go into default, which has serious consequences (see below).
Your loan becomes ""delinquent"" if your monthly payment is not received by the due date. If you fail to make a payment, we'll send you a reminder along with the servicer of your loans that your payment is late. If your account remains delinquent, we'll send you warning notices reminding you of the consequences of default and of your obligation to repay your loans.
If you are delinquent on your loan payments, contact your loan servicer immediately to find out how to bring your account current. Late fees may be added, and your delinquency will be reported to one or more national consumer reporting agencies (credit bureaus), but this is much better than remaining delinquent on your payments and going into default.
Consequences of default
If you default:
•	You will be required to immediately repay the entire unpaid amount of your loan.
•	The Department of Education may sue you, take all or part of your federal and state tax refunds and other federal or state payments, and/or garnish your wages so that your employer is required to send us part of your salary to pay off your loan.
•	You will be required to pay reasonable collection fees and costs plus court costs and attorney fees.
•	You may be denied a professional license.
•	You will lose eligibility for other federal student aid and assistance under most federal benefit programs.
•	You will lose eligibility for loan deferments.
•	Your default status will be reported to the national consumer reporting agencies (credit bureaus).
For more information and to learn what actions to take if you default on your loans, see the Federal Student Aid website for Understanding Delinquency and Default."

10000,William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program,"About the Loan
This William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program allows eligible students to borrow loans from Federal Government, which provides low interest rates and beneficial repayment options. The Federal Direct Loan Program include Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Federal Parent PLUS Loan and Federal Graduate PLUS loans.
Interest Rate and Fees
Interest is money paid to the lender in exchange for borrowing money. Interest is calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal amount (loan amount) borrowed. The interest rate varies depending on the loan type and (for most types of federal student loans) the first disbursement date of the loan. Please click here to view the current interest rates, or click here to view historical Federal Direct Loan interest rate information.
Most federal student loans have loan fees that are a percentage of the total loan amount. The loan fee is deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement you receive. This means the money you receive will be less than the amount you actually borrow. You're responsible for repaying the entire amount you borrowed and not just the amount you received.
Please click here to view the current loan fees for Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Federal Direct PLUS Loans.
New Changes/Updates
Subsidized Stafford Loan Interest Rate
College Cost Reduction and Access Act
Congress has passed and the President has signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, which ties federal student loan interest rates to financial markets. Under this Act, interest rates will be determined each June for new loans being made for the upcoming award year, which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan will have a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan.
These rates will apply to all new Federal Direct Loans made during indicated timeframe. Please click here to view the current interest rates, or click here to view historical Federal Direct Loan interest rate information.
Subsidized Stafford Loan Grace Period Interest Subsidy
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012
Stafford Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) have a grace period during which repayment is not required until six months after the student graduates, withdraws or is enrolled in less than half-time. Previously, Federal Subsidized Stafford Loans maintained the interest subsidy during the grace period. The interest subsidy will no longer be provided during the grace period for first disbursements made on or after July 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2014.
New Limit on Eligibility for Subsidized Stafford Loans
Public Law 112 - 141
A new borrower on or after July 1, 2013, will not be eligible for new Federal Direct Subsidized Loans if the period during which the borrower has received such loans exceeds 150 percent of the published length of the borrower's educational program. The law also provides that a borrower who has reached the 150-percent limit is ineligible for interest subsidy benefits on all Federal Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed to that borrower on or after July 1, 2013.
•	Borrowers may receive Federal Subsidized Direct Loans for no more than150 percent of the length of the current academic program (i.e., six years for a four-year degree)
•	Once a borrower has received Subsidized Loans for 150 percent of the length of their program, the borrower's future Federal Subsidized Direct Loan eligibility will end.
•	A student who has received Federal Subsidized Direct Loans for 150 percent of the length of their program and continues enrollment beyond that point will lose all subsidies on previously received Federal Subsidized Direct Loans. The student also will be required to pay all accumulated interest.

Students should update contact information in their myUH self-service account.
Current Students
Students who attended the University of Houston (main campus) during the fall and/or spring term will only need to register for summer classes; no additional application form is needed. Students enrolling in repeat courses for the summer are encouraged to read the Financial Aid Repeat Course Policy.
Transfer Students
Students new to the University for the spring or summer term will need to complete a Summer Transfer Monitor form if it is initiated on their myUH To-Do List. A student’s eligibility and enrollment will determine the awarding of summer financial aid.
Verification Deadline
If you are selected for verification, the UH Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will notify you via email regarding any additional information that is needed or any changes to your aid offer due to verification. Any requested information is “initiated” in your myUH To-Do List and is required to process your financial aid application. To allow time for accurate processing, the deadline to submit documents to UH for Summer 2023 financial aid is June 16, 2023. You must already have an official EFC, as a result of completing a FAFSA, processed by the U.S. Department of Education in order to submit any requested documents to our office.
Warning: If you purposely provide false or misleading information, you will be reported to the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education, and may be subject to a fine, sentenced to jail or both.
Summer Awards
Limited amounts of institutional grant assistance may be available to students who demonstrate financial need, however, funds are limited and will be awarded based on date order of summer registration. In addition, two types of federal funding sources are available for summer via the FAFSA, based on remaining eligibility: Federal Pell Grant Funds and student loans. Students also may apply for private loans with their lender.
Federal Pell Grant Program
Students eligible for the Federal Pell Grant Program can receive up to 150 percent of their scheduled Federal Pell Grant each year. This means that if you received Federal Pell Grant Program funds for both fall and spring terms, you may qualify for Federal Pell Grant Program funds for the summer.
If you enrolled full-time (12+ hours) and received your full-time Federal Pell Grant for fall and spring, you must enroll in at least half-time (6 hours) for the summer term to be offered summer Federal Pell Grant Program funds. You must have lifetime Pell Grant eligibility remaining in order to qualify for these additional funds. Being enrolled less than half-time will result in cancellation of summer Federal Pell Grant Program funds.
Federal Direct Loans
Students’ summer loan eligibility is based on their remaining annual loan eligibility for loans received at UH or another institution during the academic year. Students who received their annual loan limit the past fall and spring terms no longer have loan eligibility for the summer term. Federal Direct Loans require at least half-time enrollment (6 credit hours for undergraduate/law/optometry/pharmacy/medical students, 5 credit hours for graduate students). Students who alter their enrollment after being awarded will need to complete a Revision Request form requesting an aid adjustment. Federal Direct Loans will be canceled for students who are enrolled less than half-time.
Please note that students may not receive federal aid from multiple institutions during the same enrollment period. This would result in cancellation of aid and a resulting balance due to the University.
Annual and aggregate (career) Federal Direct Loan limits are as follows:  
Dependent Undergraduates
	Annual Limit	Aggregate Limit
	Total	Subsidized Maximum	Total	Subsidized Maximum

Federal PLUS Loans

Once a Federal PLUS Loan application has been completed online, students must complete the “Other” section of the Revision Request form to indicate that the Federal PLUS Loan be applied for the summer term. Students who want to pursue an  alternative or private loan must initiate the application process with the lender of their choice before they complete the “Other” section of the Revision Request form and indicate that the private or alternative loan be applied towards the summer term.

10000,Spring Aid,"Disclaimer: This page is to be used as a resource for students who are newly admitted for the Spring term.
Applying to UH and obtaining an admissions decision into a degree-seeking program is your first step toward completing your financial aid file. Without an admission decision, the University of Houston will not be able to load your FAFSA. 
Complete and send your FAFSA to UH. Admitted students are required to file a FAFSA for the appropriate aid year that includes our UH campus school code: 003652. If you have previously filled out the FAFSA and did not indicate our school code, you will not need to complete a new one, you will simply need to log in to your FAFSA and add the UH campus school code: 003652. It is important that your name, date of birth and social security number in your myUH student profile match the information entered on your FAFSA. Please contact the Office of the University Registrar to verify your student record. 
Please review the Student Aid Report (SAR) comments on your FAFSA. If you see an asterisk (*) symbol next to your EFC index or if you were notified by your previous institution that your file was selected for a process called verification, additional documents are required. Your specific requirements can be viewed online via your myUH account on your To-Do List. All financial aid forms are available for download and each page must contain your myUH number before you turn it in to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid.
Please make sure that you have no incomplete or initiated items on your Financial Aid To-Do List.  All required documents must include signatures and contain your myUH ID number. Students are responsible for monitoring their myUH account for additional documents that may be required. Missing information could cause a delay on your file.
Cancel pending spring aid with any other prior institutions. You may not receive aid from multiple institutions during the same enrollment period, and doing so will result in cancellation of UH aid and a balance. You will not be able to have your spring enrollment from another institution counted toward your enrollment hours at UH for financial aid purposes. If your school has not cancelled your pending spring aid and updated the National Student Loan Data System, you may be required to submit additional forms, including Transfer Monitor forms and related documents. All students will be offered aid with an assumed full-time enrollment and only based on eligibility that you have not already utilized at other institutions during the aid year. If your enrollment is less-than-full-time on and after the 12th class day, your aid will be reduced to meet the enrollment requirements. Students who are enrolled in less-than-half-time hours will not be eligible for any federal loans.
Please secure a payment plan for your classes. If you have been admitted and have registered for your classes, but have not been offered financial aid by the time your fee bill is due, or have not received enough aid to cover your bill, please visit the Office of Student Business Services for your payment options. You also may read about deferment plans and payment options, which allow you additional time to finish seeking financial assistance for your bill.
Watch your inbox for email confirmation. Once you are awarded, an email notification will be sent to the destination email address on your student profile. Please accept, adjust or decline your aid in your myUH self-service account. For details regarding your student profile or access issues, contact the IT Department. If you choose to accept Federal Direct Loans, an entrance counseling session and a Master Promissory Note (MPN) must be completed with the Department of Education by going to StudentAid.gov. If you have already completed a Master Promissory Note at your previous institution, you will not need to do it again. A loan entrance counseling session is required if you are a new University of Houston student. We are unable to obtain entrance counseling information you completed while at another institution.
Disbursements don’t occur until the semester starts. Each term, financial aid disbursement begins no earlier than the first week of classes. If you have satisfied all application and disbursement requirements and meet the conditions of the award, your financial aid will be automatically credited to your UH fee bill as a payment. Please visit our disbursement website for additional information. Students enrolled in late sessions (Sessions 4 - 6) will see their aid disbursed only after all sessions have started. If you have financial aid remaining after your tuition has been paid, UH will forward the balance to you as a refund based on your BankMobile refund preferences. Please contact Student Business Services if you have any questions about refunds."

10000,UH EMAIL ACCOUNT REQUIREMENTS,"An international student will receive email notifications and information concerning Student Health Insurance, international status, and other topics due to being identified as an International Student by the University of Houston.
The Student Health Center and Academics HealthPlans, the administrator for the UH System-endorsed Student Health Insurance Plan, will also use the UH email alias to send email notifications.
Members of the UH community receive a UH email alias and a UH email account. The email alias is a pointer that directs email messages to a destination email account. UH uses email aliases to send important information such as emergency closings or information from colleges or departments.
•	It is the responsibility of the student to ensure the UH e-mail alias points to a working e-mail address at all times. Students may update their e-mail address information by logging on to Access UH and going to myUH.
•	It is the student's responsibility to read e-mail correspondence frequently and consistently. The University recommends students read e-mails at least once a day.
•	It is the student’s responsibility to check their SPAM folder to verify that all communication is reviewed.
The university, UH Student Health Center, Academic HealthPlans, and AcademicBlue are not responsible for students missing important information due to emails being misdirected, rejected, or blocked."

The Student Health Center does not determine a student's international status, which students the university requires to maintain health insurance, or if a student is studying outside of the United States.
•	If a student is enrolled in an APPROVED distance education program and is residing outside of the United States for the full coverage period, it is the responsibility of the student to have their status updated in their university account prior to class enrollment to avoid being charged the health insurance fee.
•	If a student has already been charged the health insurance fee, changes to their status must be posted to their university account no later than the term's waiver deadline.
•	If the student later plans to enter the United States prior to the end of the current coverage period, it is the responsibility of the student to enroll in the UH System-endorsed Student Health Insurance Plan as a Qualifying Event prior to their arrival.
Contact the Online and Distance Education Department, Learning Abroad, or your department program prior to the term's posted waiver deadline if you require assistance.
Contact the International Student and Scholar Services Office prior to the term's posted waiver deadline with questions regarding your status with the university while studying outside of the United States."

Dual Credit & Early College High School

Speak with an Admissions Representative
Admissions representatives are experts when it comes to applying to the University of Houston. If you'd like to talk to an admissions representative for admissions support, you can schedule a virtual admissions advising appointment, or contact us by phone at (713)-743-1010, option 4 or by email at admissions@uh.edu.

The Appeals Committee will be looking for specific evidence beyond grades, class rank, and test scores (if applicable) that have already been considered in previous admissions attempts.
ii.	Updated High School Transcript  - Unofficial copy should include grades from most recently completed semester (typically, fall of senior year)
iii.	Resume - Appeal candidates are required to submit a resume for consideration. Please include a detailed list of any extracurricular activities, community service, work experience, accomplishments, or other pertinent activities achieved throughout high school.

90.	Residency Requirements
The University of Houston is a state university, meaning Texas residents and non-residents have different tuition rates. Residents of the state of Texas will be billed in-state tuition and non-residents will be billed out-of-state tuition.
Determining Residency
There must be conclusive evidence of a student’s intent to permanently establish domicile in Texas. Domicile means to live and maintain gainful employment in the State of Texas. Those wishing to change their residency status must show they have domiciled in the state of Texas for 12 months or more prior to the semester in which is being applied.
If the admissions application indicates you aren’t a U.S. citizen or permanent resident but that you may qualify for residency based on Texas high school graduation, you will be prompted to download and submit the Residency Affidavit. The form must be completed, signed, notarized and submitted to the university.
Residency Classification Review
Do you think you may qualify for residency in the state of Texas? If you believe you are incorrectly classified, take steps to correct the inaccuracy by submitting the Residency Questionnaire, along with supporting documents, to the Office of the Registrar.
Questions?
If you have any questions regarding residency requirements, please contact the Office of the Registrar.

10000,Transferring Credit,"Transferrable College Credit
UH may award transfer credit for all college-level, academic coursework with grade C- or better from a regionally accredited college or university. College-level coursework with grades C- or lower will not count toward academic requirements and will not count towards the pursual of a U.S. baccalaureate degree. Transferrable coursework may receive a direct equivalency or general elective credit by course subject area, if applicable. A maximum of 66 lower division (freshman and sophomore-level) semester credit hours may be transferred as course credit. There is no limitation to the number of upper division (junior and senior-level) semester credit hours that can transfer to UH. Most upper division coursework will generally be awarded as advanced elective credit. However, students must complete at least 30 semester credit hours in residence at UH to complete baccalaureate degree requirements. Developmental courses may not be considered as college-level coursework and will not be transferrable.
Calculating GPA
All coursework attempted other than developmental courses are utilized in calculating transferrable GPA for admission to UH. Repeated coursework excluded from the cumulative GPA at previous institutions will be included in the calculated GPA at UH as attempted coursework for admission decisions. Please note that GPA will be calculated upon completion of applicant’s admissions file.
Alternative Grading Basis for Transfer Credit:
Pass/Fail Grades
The University of Houston will accept and award college-level credit from regionally-accredited institutions who provide grades of S (Satisfactory) or P (Pass) during semesters impacted by COVID-19. Hours earned from S or P grades will be counted towards transfer hours, but will not be factored in the calculation of your cumulative transfer GPA and will not factor into your GPA at UH. Hours earned from F grades will count towards the calculation of your cumulative transfer GPA.
Advanced Placement (AP) Exams
The University of Houston will continue to follow our standard practices on awarding AP test scores and will accept scores taken by the online exam format through College Board due to COVID-19.
Regionally Accredited Universities
The University of Houston only accepts transferrable credit from universities with the following accreditations:
•	MSCHE: Middle States Commission of Higher Education
•	NEASC-CIHE: New England Association of Schools and Colleges–Commission on Institutions of Higher Education
•	HLC: Higher Learning Commission (HLC)
•	NWCCU: Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities
•	SACSCOC: Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges
•	ACCJC: Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges [Western Association of Schools and Colleges]
•	WSCUC: Senior College and University Commission
Students can check the accreditation of their institutions through the US Department of Education website.
Texas Common Course Numbering System (TCCNS)
The University of Houston is a participant in the Texas Course Common Numbering System (TCCNS), a cooperative effort among Texas community colleges and universities to facilitate transfer of freshman- and sophomore-level general academic courses included in the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board’s Lower-Division Academic Course Guide Manual (ACGM).
The TCCNS provides a shared, uniform set of course designations for students and their advisors to use in determining both course equivalency and degree applicability of transfer credit on a statewide basis. When students transfer between two participating TCCNS institutions, a course taken at the sending institution transfers as the course carrying, or cross-referenced with the same TCCNS designation at the receiving institution. For additional information on the TCCNS, visit the TCCNS website.

Transfer Credit Petition
Some credits (especially upper division and out-of-state credit) may be transferred as general elective credit or elective credit within a subject area. Students may choose to complete a Transfer Credit Petition eForm once they have reviewed their Transfer Credit Summary—both of which are available on their myUH account. Alternatively, students seeking to submit a hard copy Transfer Petition request must consult with their College Advisor for additional guidance and approval. However, the Transfer Petition eForm is a more efficient way to submit for faculty/department review. Petitions will be reviewed by faculty in the appropriate college and department to determine if the work and credit are of suitable content and rigor. This process takes place during the first enrolled term. The application of transfer credit toward a degree at the university cannot be determined until the transcripts have been evaluated and a degree plan is processed.

10000,University of Houston - Campus Carry Policy,"•	UH MAPP 07.01.05 - Campus Carry Policy
•	Appendix 1 - Exclusion Zone by Building Number and Name
•	Exclusion Zone Application Form
An Exclusion Zone Application should must be submitted to establish, modify, or eliminate and Campus Carry Exclusion Zone. The Exclusion Zone Application form can be found in UH MAPP 07.01.05 as well as the link above. Completed forms or questions about the form or process should be addressed to campuscarry@uh.edu or eamessa@uh.edu.
This policy was developed following months of discussion and deliberation to comply with the “Campus Carry” Law, which was passed in 2015. Campus community members, including students, faculty and staff, were invited to share their input prior to the policy development through several open forums, a campus-wide survey, and emailed comments at campuscarry@uh.edu.
The Campus Carry Law allows individuals who are liscensed to carry concealed handguns to “carry a concealed handgun on or about the license holder’s person while the license holder is on the campus of an institution of higher education” and
a.	Authorizes the president to establish reasonable rules, regulations, or other provisions regarding the carrying of concealed handguns by license holders on campus;
b.	Limits authority such that the president or officer may not establish provisions that generally prohibit or have the effect of generally prohibiting license holders from carrying concealed handguns on the campus of the institution; and
c.	Allowed for broad input from students, faculty, and staff prior to its implementation on August 1, 2016.
 The policy must also:
1.	Respect the unique nature of our campus which includes classrooms, dormitories, laboratories, athletic facilities, grade school classrooms, day care facilities, medical and psychological clinics, and multiple public auditoriums among many of our 157 buildings;
2.	Recognize the concerns of many, including our Faculty Senate which passed a resolution in opposition on December 21, 2015; and
3.	Recognize the need for appropriate storage so that license holders can safely store their firearms when necessary.
In 2021, the Texas Legislature enacted the Firearm Carry Act, House Bill (HB) 1927, which provides for Permitless Carry (sometimes referred to as “Constitutional Carry”) in certain places and under certain circumstances. HB 1927 excludes universities from the places where permitless carry is allowed. While on the University of Houston campus only a person with a valid License to Carry a Handgun (LTC) may carry weapons designated under Subchapter H of Chapter 411 of the Government Code; any other weapons are expressly prohibited.

10000,Your Role in Staying Safe,"While UHPD does everything we can to ensure that the campus is safe and secure, it is you who plays the most important role in your own safety. Below are a few tips that will help you to take ownership of your personal safety. If you have any questions on topics that you do not see covered here, or you would like to schedule a crime prevention presentation for your office or group, please contact our crime prevention officer.

PERSONAL SAFETY—BE PREPARED
By taking a few simple precautions, you can reduce the risk to yourself and also discourage those who commit crimes.
•	Always be alert and aware of the people around you.
•	Educate yourself concerning prevention tactics.
•	Be aware and avoid of locations and situations which would make you appear vulnerable to crime.
•	Learn the locations of the blue light phones in the areas you frequent. These phones are directly linked to UHPD.
•	Never do anything or go anywhere where you do not feel safe! You intuition is your best guide of what may cause you harm. Listen to it.
•	Walk on well-lit paths. Take the most traveled route to and from classes. Walk with others if possible, especially at night, or take advantage of our Security Escort Program.
•	Go easy on the alcohol. Approximately 1700 students die from alcohol-related injuries each year. Alcohol often plays a role in acquaintance and date rape. Drinking too much may impair your judgment and make you less aware of your surroundings.
 
STREET PRECAUTIONS
•	Be alert to your surroundings and the people around you—especially if you are alone or it is dark.
•	Whenever possible, travel with a friend.
•	Stay in well-lighted areas as much as possible.
•	Walk close to the curb. Avoid doorways, bushes and alleys where someone could hide.
•	Walk confidently at a steady pace.
•	Make eye contact with people when walking.
•	Do not respond to conversation from strangers on the street—continue walking.
•	If you carry a purse, bag or otter items of value, hold it close to your body; if a wallet, keep it in a front pocket.
•	Don't hold your phone in your hand while you walk, put in a pocket or bag where it isn't visible.
•	Do not use or wear anything that will impede your vision or hearing (i.e. earbuds).
 
CAR SAFETY
•	Always lock your car doors after entering or leaving your vehicle.
•	Park in well-lighted areas.
•	Have your car keys in your hand so you don't have to linger before entering your car.
•	Check the interior of your vehicle for intruders before entering your car.
•	If you think you are being followed, drive to a public place or a police station.
•	If your car breaks down, open the hood and call for roadside assistance. If someone stops to help, stay in your locked car and ask them to call the police or a tow truck service.
•	Don't stop to aid motorists by the side of the road. Make a phone call requesting help for them.
 
WHILE WAITING FOR A BUS
•	Be alert to your surroundings and the people around you.
•	Try to avoid isolated bus stops.
•	Keep your possessions on your lap at bus stops, or hidden from sight. 
•	Don't open your purse or wallet while boarding the bus—have your pass or money already in your hand.
•	Keep jewelry out of sight; don't flash jewelry; turn rings around so the stones don't show.
 
ON BOARD BUSES
•	During off hours, ride as near to the bus operator as possible.
•	If someone bothers you or makes you feel uncomfortable, change seats. Inform the driver of the situation.
•	Carry your wallet inside your coat, or in a front pocket.
•	Keep your belongings in front of you and hold close to your body with both hands.
•	Be alert to pickpocketers on crowded buses; check your purse or wallet if someone is jostling, crowding or pushing you.
 
OFFICE SECURITY
•	Never leave your purse or wallet in plain view or in common accessible areas.
•	Don't leave cash or valuables at the office.
•	If you work alone or after business hours, keep the office door locked.
•	If you work late, try to find another worker to walk out with you, or use the Security Escort Program.
•	Be alert for pickpocketers on crowded elevators.
•	Report all suspicious persons and activities to the proper authorities.
•	Be aware of escape routes for emergencies and post the police and fire department numbers near telephones.
 
UHPD recommends that all students, faculty, and staff members take a moment and enter emergency contact information in their cell phone address book/contacts under the acronym ICE (In Case of Emergency). This would assist public safety officials in contacting the person to be called in the event of an emergency if you are ever discovered unconscious or incapacitated and unable to communicate.
You should enter at least two ICE contacts with first name and relationship in your address book/contacts list. For example, your ICE entries could be: ICE - Sondra (mom) and ICE - John (brother). These entries could also be used to assist in returning your cell phone in the event that it is lost or stolen.

Entering these contacts into your cell phone should not replace the carrying of other photo identification (UH ID or license) at all times. You should also affix emergency contact information to these forms of identification.
