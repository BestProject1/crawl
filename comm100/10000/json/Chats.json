For Cullen/Business, you need a 3.25 overall, compared to CLASS where you need a 2.5. \n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: I think you may consider changing your major and apply again. \n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: OK, thank you for your help.

Or should I wait till next semester and a higher gpa to change majors?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sorry, I think Bauer business is pretty strict about the 3.25, as bauer is becoming more popular and respected. And you cannot change your major to pre-business after you hit 45 credits. So I think you may not be able to do that unless you can get 3.25 GPA by the end of this semester.

But UH only uses core classes for test-optional admissions. I think your GPA includes electives. So after recalculation your final GPA is 2.8 which does not meet the minimal requirement for the Major you applied for. \n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh god. What should I do?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sorry for that. I think if you want you can try to apply again for another major which does not have a very high requirement.

Now it's my last year at UH, and I'm worried they might take it away?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I don't have many classes left to complete, which is why I'm taking 9 credit hours per term. But in order to remain eligible for the scholarship, it needs to be 12/full-time.\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yes. If you cannot meet the least requirement for the scholarship, it will be taken away. \n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh no, is there any way to save it?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Maybe you can just sign up for an extra easy A class. THEA 1331, KIN 1304, stuff that takes very little effort and you'll get an A. That way you can stay at 12 hours and get your financial aid.\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Oh haven't thought of that.

There is a 12% APR on this plan and I was wondering if It gets added on to the payment I have to do on October 6th. Or is it like if I dont pay it on time?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: It's added on to your payment the twelfth day after classes start as it's a required part of the plan, if you have some financial aid I recommend doing the installment payment plan instead. The financial aid pays off as much of the first installment as it can so ideally your first installment would be paid off and you wouldn't have to worry about payments till later in the year (with only a $25 origination fee). If that's not an option for you and you have to do the short term plan you would have to pay that fee\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So the 12% interest gets added no matter what?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yeah unfortunately it's university policy\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So its the whole 12% getting added on at the same time??? damn. Im still waiting on a big scholarship to come in. I'll try to change it to installment.\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Yeah installment is better since any financial aid can help cover your first installment and it's only a $25 fee, good luck. \n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: OK.

So, when do I get the money? Does it come with the usual financial aid (which I'm assuming is this past March) or at the end of my freshman year?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: It will come with your financial aid. \n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: So when does the financial aid come? Does it come at the end of the school year?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: The financial aid is applied to your account at the beginning of the semester. After you are still enrolled full time by a certain date (like the 12th class day or something like that), then any balance left over will be refunded to you. Usually receive it about a month after school starts. You will want to sign up for the automatic deposit, otherwise they will send you a paper check which takes longer.\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Alright, thanks a bunch!",

So I've already received financial aid offers that aren't Cougar Promise. If I submit the form, do they change? Should I reject the loans?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Your other financial aid shouldn't change. FYI, as I understand it, the Cougar Promise will only cover the rest of your tuition and fees.

However, I heard that they give you less or even no grants at all after your freshman year. Is this true or does it just depend on your FAFSA for that year? \n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: I'm just worried because I don't want to be in a situation where I don't have enough money to attend UH after my freshman year.\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Hi, that is not true. You will get grants depending on family income through FAFSA, unless your family greatly changes income upwards, you should have no issue.\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: Great, thank you for your answer.

If you owe money to the University, it will reduce it by the amount of the grant. If it results in a credit balance, you should have a refund preference established so any credit balance is direct deposited into your own bank account. If you don't have a bank account, you can set up your Bank Mobile Vibe account. More information about getting your refund can be found here: https://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/refunds/\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: OK. I'll check this. Thank you very much. ",

Could you tell me what happened?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Visitor: so at the start of the semester I had been given the Texas Grant and it was about 9000 for both semesters, meaning about 4500 per semester. That was enough to get me by and I was alright. School started and everything was going good until yesterday when I got a disbursement notification saying that only about 1600 had been disbursed, and when I went to check my financial aid I had found that my Texas grant had been reduced to about 3200 for both semesters!

And how can I NOT be notified about this?\n[2023/06/01 16:31:17]:Nash: Sorry, I cannot see the details of that.
