Glad to help .\nIt depends on which college within UH you are trying to get into. So depending on which major you are applying for I would look up the auto acceptance stats for that's more specific to you.\nIk for General UH acceptance: Requirements w/ test are- class rank in top 25% w/ assured admission is SAT 1080 or ACT 21 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1170 or ACT 24\nBut these stats go up evry few years and are different for each college within UH for example:\nFor Bauer (business college): class rank in top 20% w/ assured admission is SAT 1270 or ACT 27 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1310 or ACT 28 Or w/out test of a 3.8/3.9 gpa respectively\nForNSM (the sciences/math): class rank in top 25% w/ assured admission is SAT 1170 or ACT 24 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1220 or ACT 25 Or w/out test of a 3.7/3.8 gpa respectively\nFor Cullen College of Engineering: class rank in top 25% w/ assured admission is SAT 1270 or ACT 27 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1320 or ACT 28\nEtc.\nSome of the colleges also have specific math/writing score requirements.\nGood luck on your application!\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

I haven't moved to Houston yet (still in Canada by the time this was posted). Not too sure how admissions work in the US in general, but how difficult would it be for me to get a spot in any program at UH, or even a community college? Bc essentially, I'm restarting life atp, and I know that the grading scheme in the states is different compared to Canada's. Would I basically need to wait till the September or regular admissions date to apply (like every other freshman)? Since it seems too soon for me to begin my studies in a new country. Also, would I have to go thru another year of school to basically meet admission prerequisites like that of every other senior hs student? I'm seeing a lot of different answers and opinions online, and they aren't very definitive nor assuring. I've yet to make calls as well since exams for me have js ended. Also, the biggest reason why I'm pressing for admission to UH is the football team (what suitable program could I do alongside varsity, if any student-athletes could inform me about their experiences and programs, it would be very helpful). Any help will be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

Your story sounds amazing.\nFirst of all, I highly suggest you contact the Transfer Advising Program (TAP). Their whole job is to help transfer students and they're amazing people. I'd recommend making an appointment with an advisor ASAP, as depending on your intended major, you may have to schedule a month in advance for an appointment.\nSecond, admissions is going to consider your most recent 66 credits (in reverse chronological order, starting from the last semester you attended). If you had to retake all of your classes at community college and all of your last 66 credits come from there, that's all that will be considered when they consider your GPA for admissions.\nThird, if you haven't seen them already, these are the transfer student admission requirements per college. This is something that a TAP advisor will go over with you during your appointment, but it doesn't hurt to look it over beforehand.\nAgain, congratulations on your degree and success! Good luck on your application and future!\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

I received an unsubsidized loan already. Initially when I called to check with the school two weeks ago about an update on my Direct Plus Loan they told me to check back in with them in 2 weeks. Two weeks passed I called back and now the person I spoke to was like 'we already dispersed your unsubsidized loan,' I told her I wasn't calling about that I was calling about the Direct plus loan- which is a totally different loan.\nAnyways they've been confusing me saying I already received my direct loan but they're referring to the unsubsidized, so she kept asking about what other loan did I apply and with whom and I keep telling her I did i through fasfa for the Direct plus loan. She keeps thinking I'm talking about the unsubsidized so I just told her I'd call back cause she had me thinking I was crazy.\nNow I just wanted to make sure these are two completely different loans so idk if they're being lazy to look into it or what.

Prior they would require a student one of 4 paths to graduation: a minor, a study abroad, a thesis \"capstone\" project, or something called course integration. I think they recently removed it because many complained that the policy led to students having to spend so much money on additional classes, or summer programs on top of our 5-year degree plan (we don't qualify for uh in 4). In addition with summer abroad having been canceled for several years, many students who were hoping to complete that requirement through that path were now left scrambling trying to finish a minor in less time, and lastly, the thesis program can only accept so many students.\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

Other buses are able to take you directly to other parts of campus (like the 25) but again, depends where you're staying / what buses are easily accessible to you. You could always get on one bus by you and transfer to a bus that takes you to campus at the transit center. Google Maps has a transit option - so use that when choosing housing.\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

Accessible, really nice environment and friends made there, genuinely a really nice place to be at. (CV1 also has mirrors to cover over the closet, toilet/bath/shower is in one room). Moody, I would only recommend it if you can get a single room if you value having privacy/living alone. That aside, there's a lot that have gone on with it. \nThe only pros besides living alone with single rooms at Moody is that the dining hall is directly connected to it, and that there's a piano in a study room there. I'm truthfully only at Moody for the cost if you couldn't afford going above a specific amount but, that aside, I would really suggest CV1 for your first year! Put yourself in a good position if you have the opportunity! Make those friends, have good community involvements (since Moody, imo, lacks this a bit). Best of luck and congratulations on being admitted! If you have any other questions, ask away!!\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100\n",

As the-anarch mentioned, you and the other 3 people in the CV1/CV2 dorm will clean the attached bathrooms yourselves, and will need to buy toilet paper as well to keep it stocked up since it isn't provided from what I can recall. If you just buy a big pack, store it under the sink, you're set. Other than that it's definitely well worth it :) Moody would be the one that (because of having communal bathrooms) has frequent cleaning\n\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

At places like the icon and Cullen oaks, you can get an apartment with a couple other roommates for like $600 or $700 a month. Plus you don't have to buy a meal plan and you can just cook, and any time you eat out or order food it will replace some of the cost of buying groceries, whereas with a meal plan, eating out will just add on to the cost of the meal plan, if that makes sense. You can get a shared bedroom/bathroom, or a private room with a private bathroom, or a private bedroom with a shared bathroom depending on your budget.\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

I created an unrealistic schedule with difficult classes and I failed two of them last semester. Now I am in academic probation. I learned my mistakes and now I am taking classes that seem reasonable to my schedule. So far I'm doing good, grade wise. However, I am not able to apply to most scholarships at the moment due to my low gpa, and will most likely have to wait til this semester ends to apply for scholarship, that is if my gpa meets the requirements.

Only apply for scholarships for which you qualify. If the scholarship says you must be from Texas and you are from Sweden, or you must be a STEM major and your major is journalism, you are wasting your time. 2). Use your serious, college-level writing skills to respond to the essay question. It is an essay that is reviewed by higher education professionals, not a text to your bestie -- so capitalization, sentence structure, punctuation and thoughtful ideas that actually address the question will advance your chances. \"i need money\" is not going to get you selected for a scholarship.\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

On the website, it says it covers the cost of tuition and \"required fees\". Does this include any funding for housing? Also, do the \"required fees\" include any other major expenses like meal plans?\n\n",

These are good options if you have a lighter course load, because since they're not actually on-campus they can schedule you for more than 20 hours.\nThere's also a bunch of on-campus jobs you can apply for through Cougar Pathway (the red University Career Services button on your AccessUH); these are going to be things like receptionists for X or Y departments, Student Center Market employees, library assistants, Cougar Grounds workers, etc.) that are a guaranteed 20 hours limit, so if you have more classes it means they can't try to schedule you over that time (not guaranteed with the off-campus jobs so watch out!!!) and these are also eligible for Federal Work-Study Programs.\nGood luck on your job search, and welcome to UH! As an unrelated tip, go to Cat's Back, the UH club rush, and go earlier than you think you have to. There are lots of clubs at UH that people have no idea even exist, and being involved in student orgs is really what gets you friends and involved with folks on campus.\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

Some of my questions are,\n1.\tIf I decide to live at home with my parents, will my room and board be $0? Or will I still be charged room and board, but for a smaller amount?\n2.\tConsidering I've received about $18,000 in financial aid from UH, would it be enough to cover my cost of attendance if I decide to live at home?\n3.\tIs the chemical engineering program recommended? Is there unnecessary grade deflation in the engineering school?\n4.\tWhat is the average class size for a chemical engineer or any engineering class?\nIf I could get some help regarding these concerns, I would greatly appreciate it :) .\n\n\n",

It's roughtly 4k-8k a year.\nChemE is pretty solid according to people I know in the program. From what I have heard, Cullen has a higher job placement than TAMU, and is probably shy if not equal to Cockrell.\nClass sizes will ultimately depend where you're at in your degree, such as Soph/Jun/Sen. During your freshman year the class sizes will be, depending on the course, somewhere between 40-100. To my understanding they usually get smaller, due to the engineering majors branching out into their departments.\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"

Is there any classes you'll recommend that could help me raise my GPA and NSM GPA?\nFor almost the past two years I been struggling with mental health that it made my GPA drop extremely. I wasn't feeling well, and I lose motivation when I needed to do classes. I just started therapy, and I am starting to become a better person. I want to get in Comp Sci, because it was something I enjoyed in high school. I understand Comp Sci high school is different than University Comp Sci, but I am not going to give up. I accept the struggle I'll be facing, so I am ready to tackle it.\nI was hoping to take come classes to help me raise my GPA and NSM GPA (both in really lows 2.0). I already ask help in pre-business but yet they weren't much help as I thought they would be.\nThis semester I am taking discrete math, intro to programming, a writing in discipline class, and Geology 1340. Because of issues this semester, it seems like I'll be doing discrete math and intro to programming again in the fall. I was hoping to do some classes in the summer, but my therapist told me that I need a semester break so summer would do best for me. I know I screwed up, but this is why I started seeking help as I hate repeating this same failures all over again.\nIf you have any questions, I don't mind answering. Just hoping to find some classes to help me. I will be adding the 2000s classes in my list just in case if I do pass discrete math and intro to programming. Thank you for taking the time to read this.\n\n\n",

It seems that there is no second semester Quantum Mechanics at UH, a course offered everywhere else only 1 Quantum mechanics class PHYS 3316. This seems to be a very important course as it covers some very important topics for the future and would like to know why it isnt offered and if PHYS 3316 covers the second semester material as well as the first semester material or just first semester material. And can I also take the second semester course at a different university as independent study if not offered.\n\n\n",

However the course Quantum 1 does go over the main concepts and properties every physics student needs.\nAfter that course, topics such as adding angular momentums, perturbation theory, and additional hydrogen atom study, are more complicated as a requirement. If you choose to come to UH, you can enroll in graduate Quantum courses, both 1 and 2. All you need is permission. It is more math intensive however, which may be the reason it is not structured similarly for undergraduate.\n\n\nThanks\nAgent Terry from Comm100"
