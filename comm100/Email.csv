"1.	Grad admission decision letter disappeared – OKAY (AREAS TO CHANGE ARE HIGHLIGHTED)
student's question: 
Hello!

I’m an incoming grad student in music major, my girlfriend and I both got admitted by UH school of music, however, her admission decision letter disappeared from her applyweb page, believe or not( at least I can’t believe it happened and the school showing no care about it) We both signed the scholarship offer letter and and it’s about the ddl to reply other schools, I hope can stay with her, anyone may think this is a problem? Any information would be greatly appreciated!

school advisor replied:
Hi! 
We are happy to assist. 
If you are given an AccessUH Account, you can log in and see the decision status there.
For the letter, if you call the Graduate Admissions office they should get it back for you.
They're a much more responsive department.

student's question: 
Thank you for your response! Yes I did, but it shows complete instead of something like admitted, which is a little strange since we already signed the scholarship letter lol😂 - 

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Glad to help. 
I think in this case you can just waiting on the grad school to approve then!
Thank you. "
"2.	GPA/SAT score for admission - GOOD

student's question: 
Hello sir! 
I’m a junior in high school and want to apply here soon. My GPA is a 3.4 and I just took my SAT 2 weeks ago so don’t have the score yet. I was wondering what GPA and SAT score that can get me into this school. I’m worried my GPA and SAT score may not be good enough for acceptance.😅

school advisor replied:
Hi. Glad to help .
It depends on which college within UH you are trying to get into. So depending on which major you are applying for I would look up the auto acceptance stats for that’s more specific to you.
Ik for General UH acceptance: Requirements w/ test are- class rank in top 25% w/ assured admission is SAT 1080 or ACT 21 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1170 or ACT 24
But these stats go up evry few years and are different for each college within UH for example:
For Bauer (business college): class rank in top 20% w/ assured admission is SAT 1270 or ACT 27 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1310 or ACT 28 Or w/out test of a 3.8/3.9 gpa respectively
ForNSM (the sciences/math): class rank in top 25% w/ assured admission is SAT 1170 or ACT 24 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1220 or ACT 25 Or w/out test of a 3.7/3.8 gpa respectively
For Cullen College of Engineering: class rank in top 25% w/ assured admission is SAT 1270 or ACT 27 class rank in top 50% w/ assured admission is SAT 1320 or ACT 28
Etc.
Some of the colleges also have specific math/writing score requirements.
Good luck on your application!"
"3.	UH Bauer Admission

student's question: 
Hello, 
Admission requirements for Bauer the college of business at the University of Houston have gone up? I swear the gpa requirement wasn’t 3.25 before. I can’t be admitted as a freshman anymore because of my credit hours but has anyone been able to transfer with a gpa less than 3.25?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 3.25 is the assured admission requirement, it was raised in Spring of 2022.
You can still get in with a 3.0-3.25, it'll just be an individual review."
"4.	do I need SAT/ACT scores for admission? – NOT GOOD

student's question: 
Hi, 
I recently graduated as a senior from high school in December and am wondering if I need to take the SAT/ACT to get in? I have a 3.813 GPA, and was ranked 13, but I think I missed the auto acceptance deadline. Do I still need to take the SAT/ACT or should I just do the holistic admission?

school advisor replied:
Dear sir,
If your 3.813 is out of 4 (UH calculated) and 13 is in the top 10%, you should be set to attend UH either way.
If they need anything else, they'll ask, and you can send in your SAT/ACT scores. This applies to both the summer and fall admissions."
"5.	Transfer Admission below 2.5

student's question:
Hello, 
I'm currently in my second semester at Texas Tech but absolutely cannot stand Lubbock and it's gone pretty terribly just location-wise, being in such a small town compared to what I'm used to, far away from family, etc. and I just really need to leave. Last semester (my first) didn't go very well and I got a 1.736 but this semester things are going much better and I can definitely fix my gpa I'm just not sure if it would be a 2.5. I tried calling admissions to ask what other criteria is considered because 2.25-2.49gpa applicants are reviewed individually but she tried to tell me it was solely gpa based. I'm just wondering if it is OK to be transferred in with less than a 2.5 or if there's any point in applying even if my gpa falls slightly below the guaranteed admission standard.

school advisor replied:
Dear sir,
You will get resoundly denied if you have less than a 2. less than a 2 puts you on academic probation at UH so there's no chance they'd accept you as a transfer.
Individual review requires you need to provide documents and reasoning why your GPA is low. Saying you didn't like the school will not get you accepted.
I totally understand you don't like the location or the school but you need to figure out what's causing you to do badly in your classes. Changing locations will not change work ethic.

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I know that the school won’t fix everything but I was really alone out here and it was my first semester I had a lot of medical stuff going on as well that’s resolved now and like I said my grades are doing much better this semester … when I apply my gpa will definitely be above a 2.0, I was just saying that last semesters wasn’t … I know I can’t get in with last semesters gpa so I’m waiting until this semester fishes at the beginning of may (deadline in mid June)

school advisor replied:
Dear sir,
I didn't say what I said to be negative, just to be realistic.
You can get through whatever hardship you're going through. Moments like this can really define ourselves and our future. Fight hard because truly you are fighting for yourself. You can do great. You have to believe it. And once you do, you will be able to accomplish any goal you set for yourself."
"6.	What's usually the timeline for CoAD admission status?

student's question:
Hi,
I wonder what's usually the timeline for CoAD admission status?

school advisor replied:
Hi there 👋, 
Last year, the acceptance letter of CoAD was sent in March 17th, so expect a decision later this month. From my understanding, they’ve been getting a lot of new applicants in the last couple of years, so the process has become quite lengthy. Any questions, feel free to reach out.

"7.	how long does it take back to receive admission?

student's question:
Hello, 
i submitted my app earlier today for fall 22 and i plan to submit my other materials by the end of next week. i was wondering how long it takes to hear back & how long it takes to receive your aid package.
i’m an auto admit by the way (i heard applications move faster if you are, could be untrue!)
so how long will it take for them to get back to me?

school advisor replied:
Dear sir,
It takes about a month. Once you get your admittance letter you should get your financial aid package soon. In as little as a week. But I’m sorry I don't know about auto admit so that could change things. You also have to take in account that since it's near the deadline of application there is a lot of people submitting them so it may take longer."
"8.	How difficult are admissions to UH?

student's question:
Hi officer, 
I'm planning on applying for prenursing at UH but.... I haven't moved to Houston yet (still in Canada by the time this was posted). Not too sure how admissions work in the US in general, but how difficult would it be for me to get a spot in any program at UH, or even a community college? Bc essentially, I'm restarting life atp, and I know that the grading scheme in the states is different compared to Canada's. Would I basically need to wait till the September or regular admissions date to apply (like every other freshman)? Since it seems too soon for me to begin my studies in a new country. Also, would I have to go thru another year of school to basically meet admission prerequisites like that of every other senior hs student? I'm seeing a lot of different answers and opinions online, and they aren't very definitive nor assuring. I've yet to make calls as well since exams for me have js ended. Also, the biggest reason why I'm pressing for admission to UH is the football team (what suitable program could I do alongside varsity, if any student-athletes could inform me about their experiences and programs, it would be very helpful). Any help will be greatly appreciated!

school advisor replied:
Hi sir,
Admissions apply to out-of-state student and international students. If you're in the top half of your class and can manage a 1200 on the SAT/24 ACT you'll probably get in based on the assured admission table on this page.
If you're not applying for Fall 2023, make sure to apply to the university and the Tier One scholarship before November 1."
"	Application fee for admission

student's question:
Hello, 
Hope this email can find the correct person to answer my question. 
my nephew applied for admission to UH undergraduate as a transfer. He already paid the application fee via Common App ($75). And Now in access.uh.edu, the admission office is asking him to pay another $75 for application fee. Does this sound right ? Should he send a screenshot of the Common App receipt to the admission office so that the application fee hold will be removed ?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Yes. This is correct. Please email the admission office with the screenshot of the proof of payment would remove the hold."

"11.	What is a GPA that would get a transfer student as close as you can get or assured guaranteed admission to Bauer?

student's question:
Hello, 
Would a 3.7 GPA suffice? Say, coming out of lonestar without doing any community service? Having lots of anxiety not being able to know whether I have a good chance or not getting in.
Applying after 3 semesters at CC.

school advisor replied:
Dear sir,
If you have 3.7 GPA, then you're going to get in.
3.25 is the assured admission for Bauer, and it'll jump up soon.

student's question:
Hi,
I thought the “assured admission” was saying you have to have a 3.25 in order to be eligible to apply for transfer.
So what you’re saying is a 3.25 gets me automatic acceptance after 30 or more post high school credit hours have been accumulated?
And would a 3.7 get me into the MIS degree plan?
and thanks for the reply! I really do appreciate it.

school advisor replied:
Dear sir, 
Assured Admission is if you apply with that GPA you get in :)
You'll probably be designated as pre-business for a bit but can start taking MIS classes.

"12.	Need assistance in contacting the admissions department

student's question:
Hi sir. 
I have applied for master's in Management Information Systems for the spring 2023 term at UoH. There has been no communication on the updates in my application. It has been over a month and the portal just shows application received. No under review or anything like that. I'm quite worried as I tried contacting pretty much every email pertaining to the admissions department and I all ever get are automated replies. Could you help me out in reaching out to the admissions department. Thank you in advance.

school advisor replied:
Dear sir, 
If you went through ApplyWeb, it'll just be under review until it changes. Same with AccessUH. If you check that, it'll show a ""View Status"". Once a decision is made, you'll be notified and if you're in it'll be a big green checkmark."

Hello, 
It depends, if your second major or third major is “Exploratory Studies” and u meet the automatic admission standards then u should be good. If not, then you should worry!!"
"1.	Grad School Financial help

student's question:
Hi sir,

I was recently accepted into the Biomedical Engineering masters (online summer 2023) program, and was wondering if any current or former masters students can give insight on financial help- are there any specific scholarships that can help fund coursework that I should apply to? Am I eligible to work as a TA/RA?
Thanks!

school advisor replied:
Hi sir,
Generally, you can apply to work as a TA/RA but in programs that offer a doctoral degree most or all of that funding goes to doctoral students. Everyone that I have known who has gotten an assistantship as a Master's student with one exception has also been accepted into the ph.d. program at the same time. The only exception was someone who had known his advisor since undergrad and specifically worked with the advisor on tasks related to a journal he edited, and the funding may have come from the journal.

student's question:
Hi sir,
Thank you for your quick response. So it won’t be applicable in my case, because I’m not going for my phd, only masters, right?

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Depending on your departments needs, it is possible. Your department Director of Graduate Studies will tell you with much more certainty. It looks like that is Kirill Larin.

student's question:
I really appreciate your help! I’ll go ahead and email him. Thank you :)

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Good luck! In that field, I would definitely suggest searching hard for grant support outside the university and paid internships, too.

I definitely will be! Thank you again.🤗

"Admissions Question.
 
student's question:
Hello, 
I flunked out of a four-year college (Texas Tech) for many reasons(homelessness and drugs). I got clean and started taking classes at a community college. I am getting my associates in the Spring.
My gpa at the 4 year college was around .5 or .6. Will my gpa from the 4 year college hinder me transferring to UofH despite having an associates degree? Any advice is welcome.
Community College GPA is a 2.75.

school advisor replied:
Dear sir,
Congrats on everything you've accomplished! Your story sounds amazing.
First of all, I highly suggest you contact the Transfer Advising Program (TAP). Their whole job is to help transfer students and they're amazing people. I'd recommend making an appointment with an advisor ASAP, as depending on your intended major, you may have to schedule a month in advance for an appointment.
Second, admissions is going to consider your most recent 66 credits (in reverse chronological order, starting from the last semester you attended). If you had to retake all of your classes at community college and all of your last 66 credits come from there, that's all that will be considered when they consider your GPA for admissions.
Third, if you haven't seen them already, these are the transfer student admission requirements per college. This is something that a TAP advisor will go over with you during your appointment, but it doesn't hurt to look it over beforehand.
Again, congratulations on your degree and success! Good luck on your application and future!"

Hi, 
According to the FAFSA website, you can only receive financial aid for one school at a time.

student's question:
Hello, 
Oh okay. I read that the two institutions can have an agreement and you can get aid for both, thank you.

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
That's called a consortium agreement, where one school agrees to use any financial aid refund you may have to pay tuition and fees at the other school, as well as count your enrollment at both schools in calculating your financial aid.
HCC and UH both accept consortium agreements but don't initiate them, so unfortunately it's impossible to have one between UH and HCC"

Hi dear advisor, 
For the Fall 23’ semester, I’m intent on taking all online classes and because I commute I’d prefer take frameworks online as well. However I’d like any insight on each professors class. The only online classes that are offered are taught by Parthasarathy, but I’m open to taking Harris’ face-to-face classes. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.

school advisor replied:
Dear sir, 
Harris is a really great prof. Since she's been teaching for so long, she knows what students tend to miss on tests, and she tells you that so you can watch-out for it. She also tells you what you need to do to be successful. She explains/lays everything out really well - after that, it's up to the student on how much effort they want to put in.
For Partha, students love her when she taught the 2 principles accounting classes. Students who had/have her for frameworks really like her teaching.
Imo, I don't think you can go wrong with either prof!"

student's question:
Hello, 
So I applied for a Direct Plus loan for grad school. I received an unsubsidized loan already. Initially when I called to check with the school two weeks ago about an update on my Direct Plus Loan they told me to check back in with them in 2 weeks. Two weeks passed I called back and now the person I spoke to was like “we already dispersed your unsubsidized loan,” I told her I wasn’t calling about that I was calling about the Direct plus loan- which is a totally different loan.
Anyways they’ve been confusing me saying I already received my direct loan but they’re referring to the unsubsidized, so she kept asking about what other loan did I apply and with whom and I keep telling her I did i through fasfa for the Direct plus loan. She keeps thinking I’m talking about the unsubsidized so I just told her I’d call back cause she had me thinking I was crazy.
Now I just wanted to make sure these are two completely different loans so idk if they’re being lazy to look into it or what. So I guess I’m just trying to make sure the direct plus and the direct unsubsidized are two different ones?

Hi Peter, 
Yes direct plus is different from unsubsidized loan.

Hi, I’ve heard that a college requiring either a double major or a minor as part of the graduation requirements, is this true?

Hello, 
The College of architecture and design had requirements like this until this past year. Prior they would require a student one of 4 paths to graduation: a minor, a study abroad, a thesis ""capstone"" project, or something called course integration. I think they recently removed it because many complained that the policy led to students having to spend so much money on additional classes, or summer programs on top of our 5-year degree plan (we don't qualify for uh in 4). In addition with summer abroad having been canceled for several years, many students who were hoping to complete that requirement through that path were now left scrambling trying to finish a minor in less time, and lastly, the thesis program can only accept so many students."

student's question:
Hello,

Hi Nathen, 
Definitely make sure the housing you pick will be easily accessible to a bus stop / route to take you to campus. #4 bus goes from bellaire transit center to eastwood transit center, but stops at the fertitta center and architecture building on campus. Other buses are able to take you directly to other parts of campus (like the 25) but again, depends where you're staying / what buses are easily accessible to you. You could always get on one bus by you and transfer to a bus that takes you to campus at the transit center. Google Maps has a transit option - so use that when choosing housing."
"34.	Housing advice

student's question:
Hey, I got admitted to UofH and what would your advice be about freshmen housing (and why ?) Cougar village 1 or 2 / moody towers ?

school advisor replied:
Hello, 
For freshman housing, I would really recommend CV1! Accessible, really nice environment and friends made there, genuinely a really nice place to be at. (CV1 also has mirrors to cover over the closet, toilet/bath/shower is in one room). Moody, I would only recommend it if you can get a single room if you value having privacy/living alone. That aside, there's a lot that have gone on with it. 
The only pros besides living alone with single rooms at Moody is that the dining hall is directly connected to it, and that there's a piano in a study room there. I'm truthfully only at Moody for the cost if you couldn't afford going above a specific amount but, that aside, I would really suggest CV1 for your first year! Put yourself in a good position if you have the opportunity! Make those friends, have good community involvements (since Moody, imo, lacks this a bit). Best of luck and congratulations on being admitted! If you have any other questions, ask away!!

student's question:
Hey, thanks for the reply. In CV1 or CV2 there is an attached bathroom for 2 bedrooms.. and my doubt is how frequently are they cleaned 🤔

school advisor replied:
Hello, 
Yeah ofc!! As the-anarch mentioned, you and the other 3 people in the CV1/CV2 dorm will clean the attached bathrooms yourselves, and will need to buy toilet paper as well to keep it stocked up since it isn't provided from what I can recall. If you just buy a big pack, store it under the sink, you're set. Other than that it's definitely well worth it :) Moody would be the one that (because of having communal bathrooms) has frequent cleaning

school advisor replied:
Hello, 
I would suggest getting a campus apartment! At places like the icon and Cullen oaks, you can get an apartment with a couple other roommates for like $600 or $700 a month. Plus you don’t have to buy a meal plan and you can just cook, and any time you eat out or order food it will replace some of the cost of buying groceries, whereas with a meal plan, eating out will just add on to the cost of the meal plan, if that makes sense. You can get a shared bedroom/bathroom, or a private room with a private bathroom, or a private bedroom with a shared bathroom depending on your budget."

Hi, 
I think it is one of your options.

Thank you for the suggestion. I will make a post asap abt if anyone wants to sublease their apartment!

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
i just saw your comment about working downtown. i’d honestly recommend looking at apartments in med center. the third ward area by UH is okay but isn’t the safest. if safety is important to you, look at the med center area."
"38.	can I get in-state waiver as an international student for UG?

student's question:
Hello, 
So i got admitted to Texas tech and received in-state scholarship and $2000 scholarship but i want to come to UH. I got admitted to UH for business degree but i haven't heard any info regarding scholarship, so i was wondering whether my scholarship from TTU(texas tech University) would be applicable here as well as the UH website said i would be able to get in state tuition if any competitive uni gives minimum of $1000 scholarship

school advisor replied:
Hello, 
Yeah, if UH offers you $1000 your tuition becomes in-state! The competitive university scholarships come from UH (or possibly other sources related to it)."

SAT: 1500 (800 math 700 EVBRW)
GPschool advisor replied: 3.85 Unweighted 4.62 weighted

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Glad to help. 
It depends on when you applied, UH’s internal scholarships (Academic Excellence for example) are awarded to students who applied before the priority deadline, which is sometime in the first week of November. State grants like TPEG and TEXAS are determined by your fafsa, but again, if you apply before Jan 15 then you maximize the amount of aid you get"
"41.	Summer Scholarships or Grants from UH

student's question:
Hello. 
This is my first yr at UH, but my second year in college. Last academic school year I was in community college and had like a 3.7 gpa. I then transferred to UH last fall thinking it would be a piece of cake…….I was so wrong. I created an unrealistic schedule with difficult classes and I failed two of them last semester. Now I am in academic probation. I learned my mistakes and now I am taking classes that seem reasonable to my schedule. So far I’m doing good, grade wise. However, I am not able to apply to most scholarships at the moment due to my low gpa, and will most likely have to wait til this semester ends to apply for scholarship, that is if my gpa meets the requirements. Basically I don’t know how I’m gonna pay for school next yr and I don’t want to take out any loans. What would y’all do in my case?

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Sorry to tell you that it will already be too late to apply for scholarships and grants once u meet the minimum gpa requirement. If you’re lucky you may get some grant but it wouldn’t be enough to cover tuition. If you still have classes that you can take at community college then I would just do that because if it’s more affordable and you can avoid taking loans."
"42.	How do i know if i still qualify for my scholarship if i just dropped a class?

student's question:

Hi sir, 
I’ve checked for you and you are still qualified for that scholarship. Don’t worry. "
"43.	Scholarships help?

student's question:
Hello, 
Ive been in contact with the admissions and financial aid departments through email for the past two months regarding a the academic excellence scholarship (im a high school senior) but all efforts seem to lead to deadends. What should i do because they just redirect me to other departments and it seems like its no help at all.

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Sorry for the inconvenience. What is your question specifically?

student's question:
Hello, 
They had an issue processing my sat scores on time even though they had been sent before the deadline for supporting information and wanted to see what could be done since i had everything submitted on time for the scholarship

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
I think in this case, you definitely need to go in person and inquire about it. Over the phone is hard to get straight answers as they would just transfer you over and over. Walk ins are allowed and they tend to be very helpful in person."
"44.	Academic Excellence Scholarship

student's question: 
Hi, 
I’ve got the academic excellence scholarship which is $6,000 a year. Would you please tell me what % of full cost of attendance does that cover?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
If you are a full time student but a commuter, depending on what college or major you go to: around 50%. If it’s $6k a year, they will split that for fall and spring semester. So, you will have $3k each semester.

student's question:
Thank you. 
Does it renew by itself or do I have to apply again? Like this past semester I had it so will it automatically be taken into my 2nd semester?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
It renews automatically! You'll get an email sent to you when they find that you're still eligible every semester to tell you it's been renewed.
And to add to this - you should be able to petition them if for some reason you can't meet the credit hour requirement."
"45.	Scholarship Universe

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I’ve started applying for scholarships and wanted to know if i should use scholarship universe. I’ve never really heard anyone win anything from there and wanted to know if I’m wasting my time on that website or not? Also, what are some websites that people have actually won scholarships from?

school advisor replied:
Dear sir,
Over $1 million was awarded from UH endowed accounts to UH students through Scholarship Universe for this academic year, and more departmental scholarships are being added to the platform all the time.
There are two keys to maximize your chances: 1). Only apply for scholarships for which you qualify. If the scholarship says you must be from Texas and you are from Sweden, or you must be a STEM major and your major is journalism, you are wasting your time. 2). Use your serious, college-level writing skills to respond to the essay question. It is an essay that is reviewed by higher education professionals, not a text to your bestie -- so capitalization, sentence structure, punctuation and thoughtful ideas that actually address the question will advance your chances. ""i need money"" is not going to get you selected for a scholarship.

"46.	Academic Excellence Scholarship

student's question:
Hi sir, 
So, to put it short. I have the stats for the academic excellence scholarship based on previous year achievers and all my stuff was sent in, but the SAT came into issue. Collegeboard had sent it on November 8th to UH, but I don't think UH processed it by the supporting information deadline. Should I explain my circumstances to them and maybe get a response or am I out of Luck here.

school advisor replied:
Hi Daniel,
If it was received by UH by the deadline, the students record is considered complete, even if it hasn't been processed by that date. Although the first round of AES awards have gone out, there will be subsequent rounds while the Admissions Office processes the huge volume of records that come in for that deadline. AES awarding is not completed yet.
That being said, each year is analyzed based on the statistics of the pool of applicants for that year, so just because someone fell within the parameters of this year's awardees, doesn't mean they will be in the group for the next year."
"47.	Tier One Scholarship Decision Time?

student's question:
Hello, I just completed my interview at the Tier One Invitational on Saturday. Do you have any idea how long it takes to find out if I have received a scholarship?

In most cases, you will receive the scholarship around Feb 28th. Early march/late Feb is the norm. If you don’t get it though you probably won’t get any like notification."

student's question:
Hi sir, 
What if I dont have an 3.0 GPA at the end of the fall semester but I take a winter mini course and it goes up will that count for the 3.0 semester requirement?

school advisor replied:
Hi, if you don't meet the 3.0 GPA requirement they don't automatically take your scholarship away. They'll give you a warning, and time to get it back up I believe. If worse comes to worse & you lose it you can appeal to get it back. Don't worry too much & just try to get it up next semester/asap."
"49.	Does the national merit scholarship cover housing?

student's question:
Hi, I'm looking into U of H and was curious if you could answer some questions about the National Merit Scholarship. On the website, it says it covers the cost of tuition and ""required fees"". Does this include any funding for housing? Also, do the ""required fees"" include any other major expenses like meal plans?

I am an international transfer student and I meet the requirements for the transfer scholarship. is there a place I need to apply at or will it just be awarded to me? also, please do let me know if there are other Scholarships for international students. thank you :)

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
If you transfer in Fall semester, and your gpa is greater than 3.0. You will be awarded Transfer Excellent Scholarship. $1000 and you will be able to pay in-state tuition fee. The scholarship in Spring semester is harder to get.

student's question:
hi, 
thanks for your reply.
is it possible to get the same scholarship in the spring semester?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
If you can have another $1000 scholarship, but I think it is hard. Because it is so competitive in UH."

-290 volunteer hours
-involvement in Hosa,Nhs,student council(vice president), senior council (fundraising committee), red cross,

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Seems 1350 still puts you in the 91st percentile? Which is great! Make it clear in your app that you're committed to attending UH. Many people who are awarded Tier One scholarships end up declining the award in favor of attending other universities. A large goal of those scholarships is to attract top students to attend the University."

"53.	Can I still get scholarships for honors college if I apply after the deadline?

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I’m a senior currently in the process of applying to colleges and I’ve recently become interested in the UH Honors College, however I’ve found that you have a priority scholarship deadline of Nov 1, and there’s no way I’ll be able to get all my stuff done for it in the next two weeks. I probably will be able to complete the regular UH admissions by the priority deadline though. So if I apply to Uh honors college after the priority scholarship deadline, how much are my chances of getting a scholarship affected? Is there no chance, or is it just more unlikely, if I submit it after nov 1.

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Sorry that you will have no chance after the deadline, so please try to finish it before the deadline!!
To add to this, you don’t need a personal statement, all you need is the regular common app (if that’s what you’re using) stuff which should take you a couple hours to do, except for perhaps the financial info if asked."
"54.	Academic Scholarships!

student's question:
Hi, would you please tell me about the academic scholarships? I hear that UH offers a lot. I am in the top 3% of my class and applying test optional.

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Here is the link about academic scholarship.
Please don’t apply test optional if you want an academic scholarship. Most students apply with a test score, and you’ll be less likely to get a scholarship without a score. Even if you’re top 3%… don’t make that mistake. If you have a test score good enough ( I would say <1290SAT or <28 ACT), then send it in."

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I am an incoming freshman starting in the fall and I am looking for a new job. I've already finished high school so all I'm doing right now is working but I don't like my job, even though it pays fairly well (I'm a pharmacy tech at Walgreens). Any suggestions on what kind of jobs I should look for? I am also worried about finding a new job and then leaving when I start school so they won't hire me, but I do live in the Houston area so jobs near UH work as well. TIA :)

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
For jobs around UH, there's a number of technically-off-site restaurants (The Nook & Rooftop, Pink's Pizza, Domoishi, Boba Chick, The Den, etc.) that are very close. These are good options if you have a lighter course load, because since they're not actually on-campus they can schedule you for more than 20 hours.
There's also a bunch of on-campus jobs you can apply for through Cougar Pathway (the red University Career Services button on your AccessUH); these are going to be things like receptionists for X or Y departments, Student Center Market employees, library assistants, Cougar Grounds workers, etc.) that are a guaranteed 20 hours limit, so if you have more classes it means they can't try to schedule you over that time (not guaranteed with the off-campus jobs so watch out!!!) and these are also eligible for Federal Work-Study Programs.
Good luck on your job search, and welcome to UH! As an unrelated tip, go to Cat's Back, the UH club rush, and go earlier than you think you have to. There are lots of clubs at UH that people have no idea even exist, and being involved in student orgs is really what gets you friends and involved with folks on campus."

I got a physical copy of the document to get it filled out at a clinic. On the UH website, I'm probably dumb or not but it doesn't really say on how to submit in-person and it really doesn't tell you how to submit it in the self service. Could you please help me on this?

student's question:
Hi, I've recently committed to UH as an incoming freshman and signed up for a pre-orientation in early June. Could you just give me pointers or advice on their pre-orientation experience, what to expect, anything else? Thanks!

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
We don’t have pre-orientation in June. Pre-orientation are the modules you have to take online before your actual orientation. Do you mean actual orientation?

student's question:
Hi sir, 
Apparently it’s a 2 day/overnight stay at UH where you meet your counselor and plan out your classes. The website doesn’t include much info on anything about it though

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Oh, so that’s your actual orientation. Pre-orientation are modules you have to do online before your 2-day orientation . I think you can access it through the holds or to-do list on uh self-service. Another thing you can do if you are a stem major is to do the math placement test, so you can qualify for pre-cal or calc 1. Another thing to do is the bacterial meningitis shot. Also, send in a picture for your cougar card before orientation and make an appointment for after your orientation ends so you pick it up before school and head home.

student's question:
Ah I see, I appreciate this info. Yeah I have seen a few holds in my self service account so I will make sure to get those done beforehand. Thanks again!

"61.	Help/advice on cost of attendance.

student's question:
Hi sir,
Lately, I've been thinking about whether it would be a good financial decision for me to attend UH. To me, going to school almost debt-free is extremely important and was one of the main reasons why I decided not to go to UT Austin or Texas A&M after receiving very little aid from them. Some of my questions are,
1.	If I decide to live at home with my parents, will my room and board be $0? Or will I still be charged room and board, but for a smaller amount?
2.	Considering I've received about $18,000 in financial aid from UH, would it be enough to cover my cost of attendance if I decide to live at home?
3.	Is the chemical engineering program recommended? Is there unnecessary grade deflation in the engineering school?
4.	What is the average class size for a chemical engineer or any engineering class?
If I could get some help regarding these concerns, I would greatly appreciate it :) .

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
If it is 18k per year it definitely covers cost at UH
You won't be charged for room and board, unless you choose to live on campus. It's roughtly 4k-8k a year.
ChemE is pretty solid according to people I know in the program. From what I have heard, Cullen has a higher job placement than TAMU, and is probably shy if not equal to Cockrell.
Class sizes will ultimately depend where you’re at in your degree, such as Soph/Jun/Sen. During your freshman year the class sizes will be, depending on the course, somewhere between 40-100. To my understanding they usually get smaller, due to the engineering majors branching out into their departments."

"65.	Computer Science Transfer.

student's question:
Hello, I am a out of state resident wishing to transfer to the University Of Houston for Computer Science I was wondering if it is competitive to get in the program? I was also wondering is the computer science classes hard at the UH? And if there are Inter-ships opportunities in Houston or at the school? Would you recommend someone to go to the UH for computer science?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Competitive to get in: No, but it should be.
Difficulty: Data Structures and the CORE 3000 level classes will eat you alive. The rest of the advanced electives you take towards graduation can be really hard (but the fun kind of hard) or the not fun hard. Very rarely any blowoffs. The professors at that level who do research in their field actually seem to enjoy teaching it.
Recommendation: Yes. It's a solid program, needs a bit of boosting from the ranks and more respect from UH Admin, but I see a lot of people getting jobs from here, whether it is in the city or in Big Tech, even when this industry is falling sideways.
The CS students are actually pretty supportive of each other and have separate resources for CougarCS, job hunting, and other clubs. "

Hi,
I was admitted to the Architecture school for Fall 2023 and I'm at a loss for what needs to be done after this point. I'm going into this whole thing blind essentially. I've registered for orientation already and have been keeping up with the communications on myUH, but outside of that I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.
How do I find out financial aid? Do I just go to the financial aid office? Do I have to wait for some kind of email to find out whether or not I've been offered financial aid? Would they have sent a financial aid offer with the admission letter?
I'm lost, any insights would be greatly appreciated.

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
You’ll see everything in your self service portal on AccessUH. Basically there’s nothing for you to do until orientation. At orientation you’ll have the holds lifted from your account and will be able to enroll in classes. Financial aid offers will be shown in your account when they’re available."

student's question:
Hi there! Is there any classes you'll recommend that could help me raise my GPA and NSM GPA?
For almost the past two years I been struggling with mental health that it made my GPA drop extremely. I wasn't feeling well, and I lose motivation when I needed to do classes. I just started therapy, and I am starting to become a better person. I want to get in Comp Sci, because it was something I enjoyed in high school. I understand Comp Sci high school is different than University Comp Sci, but I am not going to give up. I accept the struggle I'll be facing, so I am ready to tackle it.
I was hoping to take come classes to help me raise my GPA and NSM GPA (both in really lows 2.0). I already ask help in pre-business but yet they weren't much help as I thought they would be.
This semester I am taking discrete math, intro to programming, a writing in discipline class, and Geology 1340. Because of issues this semester, it seems like I'll be doing discrete math and intro to programming again in the fall. I was hoping to do some classes in the summer, but my therapist told me that I need a semester break so summer would do best for me. I know I screwed up, but this is why I started seeking help as I hate repeating this same failures all over again.
If you have any questions, I don't mind answering. Just hoping to find some classes to help me. I will be adding the 2000s classes in my list just in case if I do pass discrete math and intro to programming. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
You can try to take whatever you can to get a 2.5 across everything (math, science, overall courses have to be above that) and it will let you switch.
The classes you are taking so far can do the trick. Discrete is a little difficult, but put in the work and you'll do it. Good luck!

student's question:
Hi sir, 
Is there any classes you'll recommend? Is cause I already took all of my basics. Bio 1 and 2, Chem 1, all of my history and Eng classes. I really don't know what to do.

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Dropping a class doesn't affect your gpa nor give you a grade, but the drop is remembered and you can only have up to 6 drops across your entire college time. Better than failing though, which does hurt your gpa.
Def drop if you know you're going to fail, and can drop without affecting financial aid."
"71.	Dropped class impact for transfer.

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I am a current freshman wanting to transfer into the chemE program next fall sem. I currently have a 3.0 GPA, and my math classes probably won't meet the minimums. Are the admission requirements hard requirements? Or is there some leeway? I know at UH the GPA scale is calculated based on a +/- letter grade scale, whereas my current uni calculates GPA with hard letter cutoffs (89 = B = 3.00) vs. at UH (89 = B+ = 3.33). Does this make any difference at all in how admissions would evaluate my transcript?

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Have you done ENGI 1100 yet? Also chemE is a more common engineering so I think it might be pretty full, you may consider adding some of the smaller/newer disciplines so you get into the engineering college. I suggest talking to one if the 1100 professors because they can give you some direction on how to get in. If you need the professors’ contact, here it is. "

If I get credits from sophia classes for HCC are those credits able to transfer over to UH? I was thinking about taking some of them for HCC but I'm not sure if UH will accept them for when I transfer.

Hi, I think you'd have to get your transcript from HCC, or Sophia, and have that sent over to UH. Try to see if HCC will take care of them. The other ones will transfer too.
There’s a credit transfer tool on HCC’s and UH’s websites that you can check. Both these schools are under some Texas law that says their curriculum will be the same for the named course, and transferable. Like HCC college algebra will be the same college algebra at UH credit, curriculum, or otherwise.

student's question:
Thank you. 
I guess the larger question is, if I transfer classes to HCC and then transfer classes to UH, do the non-hcc classes automatically transfer as well or do I need to transfer them again from the original institution?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
The non-HCC courses will transfer to UH.
You can check that they’re on your transcript rn and that’s what will be sent over. Whether they will count at UH is what they credit tool is for ig"
"76.	If I file for my degree plan now would it stop me from transferring a missing AP credit?

student's question:
Dear advisor, 
On Bauer it says
""All courses transferred in from another institution must be submitted, evaluated, and updated by the Transfer Center at the University of Houston in order to file your degree plan with the Bauer College of Business.""
So is it fine to file it now?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Yes. It is fine to file it now. AP credits are test credits, not transfer credits.  Please file your degree plan ASAP. "
"77.	How do I transfer to the University of Houston?

student's question:
Hello sir, 
I'm attending the University of Texas at Austin but am considering transferring to the University of Houston. Initially, I am from Houston so I believe it would be easier and more affordable just to attend college here. I also have been getting homesick so that could also be a factor. I would like to know what the process looks like. Do you know who I can contact to look more into this? Thank you in advance!

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Welcome and it is surely possible to transfer from UT to UH. 
You can contact the Transfer Advising Program to get you started! :)"
"78.	Transfer

student's question:
Hi, I applied as a transfer in UH. How long will it take for decision to come out?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
When did you apply and for what semester?

student's question:
I applied yesterday.

school advisor replied:

Hi sir, 
I think you will get a confirmation email within 2 weeks. "
"79.	transferred into UH nursing from another school?

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I got waitlisted at my current school, so now I’m looking at other nursing schools in Texas. I noticed that there isn’t a direct transfer into UH nursing program so I was wondering if it is possible? —what major should I go into at UH. I rlly don’t want to do pre-nursing all over again just to not get in 😫

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Unfortunately for UH’s nursing program since we only accept 14-15 transfer credits, and all applicants must have completed the majority of their coursework at UH, your only option would be to start over here at UH.
Given that you don’t want to do that (for very obvious reasons), UH cannot accept you."
"80.	Application status

student's question:
Hi sir, 
So I recently applied to UH and on my to do list it says I still have to do submit my fee waiver form. Is this mandatory or not because I already submitted my application fee and transcripts?

school advisor replied:
Hi. 
This is not mandatory. You can just ignore this if you do not want to submit."
"81.	Should I go ahead with my application?

student's question:
Hi sir, 
So, I applied to UH via ApplyTexas well before the November 1st priority deadline. And the deadline for submitting documents, test scores and application fee was November 8th. However, I didn't get my login information until November 15th. I even tried emailing the admissions team about this On November 7th but but no response. I called them today about this and they said they can't do anything now. I really love UH but I also need the scholarship since I'm OOS. It's clearly not my fault. Is there any point in going ahead with my application anymore? Is there any chance they'll still award me the Academic Excellence scholarship?

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
AES are given out around mid December so if you don’t have it by the end of it, then I would say wait. Even then, you may be able to get a sizable financial package. As your application was not complete by November 8th, you wont be getting any scholarships. But if you submit your remaining documents like transcripts now, we will consider you for admission. "
"82.	can I take a course at community college and be a full time student at UH at the same time?

student's question:
Hi sir, 
can I take a course at community college and be a full time student at UH at the same time?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Yes you can, but you can only use financial aid at one institution. So this is not recommended. You can get your first 90 credits, but not for the last 30. "
"83.	Easy Natural Science Courses?

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I need quite literally the easiest core science possible. I have already taken solar systems PHYS 1304.

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
You can take any of the Geology, like Natural Disasters. Or take physical geology with professor Daniel Hauptvogel. "
"84.	No second semester Quantum Mechanics course at UH?

student's question:
Hi 
I am an incoming freshman to University of Houston and want to know about the Physics courses. It seems that there is no second semester Quantum Mechanics at UH, a course offered everywhere else only 1 Quantum mechanics class PHYS 3316. This seems to be a very important course as it covers some very important topics for the future and would like to know why it isnt offered and if PHYS 3316 covers the second semester material as well as the first semester material or just first semester material. And can I also take the second semester course at a different university as independent study if not offered.

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
I agree that it would be much better if there was a second quantum course, preferably an elective. However the course Quantum 1 does go over the main concepts and properties every physics student needs.
After that course, topics such as adding angular momentums, perturbation theory, and additional hydrogen atom study, are more complicated as a requirement. If you choose to come to UH, you can enroll in graduate Quantum courses, both 1 and 2. All you need is permission. It is more math intensive however, which may be the reason it is not structured similarly for undergraduate."
"85.	Has the course registration for fall & summer 2023 open up yet?

student's question:
Hi sir, 
my enrollment period is April 10. I was wondering when does the enrollment period first begin

school advisor replied:
Hi,
The schedules are available now, but registration doesn't open until April 5th.
Please note that your enrollment period is when you are allowed to enroll in classes. It’s based on priority. Seniors, honor students, and UHin4 students get highest priority so we’ll actually have our enrollment period start at April 5th.
Just have all of the classes you want to take next semester in a shopping cart so you can enroll all at once in your enrollment period starts."
"86.	Course Limit

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I thought for summer I was allowed to take four classes, but it’s only letting me enroll in two. Who do I talk to about this issue?

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
This is not an issue. 
The session makes the difference too. For session 2 and 4, you can only do 7 hours max for each."
"87.	German elementary Language Courses

student's question:
Hello, 
I'm interested in taking German language courses and I'm struggling to find the elementary starting courses on the course search on UH self service. I can't find anyone to contact regarding this as well.. Would you help me to understand who I could contact regarding trying to take these courses?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Of course. The courses will be taught by Tanja Reifenrath and should be available. The first class is only available in the Fall and the second only in the Spring.
Are you searching “GERM” for the Fall 2023 semester? You may have another filter checked off that might be throwing off the results. They are only available in-person. I just searched and the results for beginning German showed up.
Just so you know, the classes are 2 and 1/2 hours long per meeting. It takes up a lot of room in class time slots. Good luck!"
"88.	German elementary Language Courses

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I’m a senior who pushed all their math requirements as late as possible and I’m supposed to graduate in December but need three math/reasoning courses (http://publications.uh.edu/content.php?catoid=44&navoid=15895) to graduate. Would you please let me know of the ones you think were easy as pie. Thanks in advance!

Hi, 
I suggest you try Intro to Geometric Reasoning, or Logic 1301. They are not too hard. "
"89.	Tuition

student's question:
Hi, would you please tell me what happens if I don’t pay my deferred plan by Monday? What’s the fee? Will it not let me register for classes?

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
The fee is $25 if you don’t pay your deferred plan. And a financial hold will be placed on your account.

student's question:
Will it affect the classes I enrolled in for summer/fall?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
No, if you are already enrolled, it won't kick you out. But you should get it cleared up before the next semester starts. Otherwise the system may not let you attend then."
"90.	New student orientation help

student's question:
Hi, 
I’m trying to register for the New Student Orientation but whenever I try to put my card info in to pay it says “you are not authorized to access this component (40,20)” I asked UIT about it yesterday and all they told me was to clear my cache and try again (didn’t help). As for google, nothing even comes up when I try to search. Please help, I need to get this figured out quickly so I can schedule around it. Thanks!

"91.	UH Class Ring, help!

student's question:
Hi sir, 
So, I purchased my class ring yesterday before the March 10 deadline to be included in the ring ceremony, and when I ordered the ring, it asked for my home address at checkout. So, I was wondering if it would be shipped to UH where I would receive the ring at the ring ceremony—which is how I thought it worked? Anyways, the Balfour employee told me I’d receive an email after I purchased the ring—asking if I would attend the ceremony or not, and I haven’t received it yet. Should I wait a little longer for the email or get worried lol

school advisor replied:
Hi, good afternoon. 
The address is for reference. After it's made, the ring will be included for blessing by Shasta VII. You can see it in the giant box at the Houston Zoo when it's time. If you are unable to attend the formal ring ceremony to pick yours up, you pick it up from an admin. office somewhere on campus which they will let you know in the email.

student's question:
Okay thank you! Also, do I need to register to attend the formal ring ceremony?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Yes, you do. You'll be asked how many guests you will bring. Anticipate the email in April, all the ceremonies are in May."
"92.	Submitting Transcripts

student's question:
Hi dear advisor, I have a question. 
If I already submitted my application as a transfer for this upcoming fall , say if I submit an official transcript right now so I can start registering for courses, when my summer courses and spring courses end and are officially a part of my transcript can I then submit another updated transcript to Uh in august so those courses can transfer as that’s when everything will be completed? Because if I wait until June or July to send transcripts I might not be able to register for courses as they might all be fully booked?

school advisor replied:
Hi sir, 
Glad to assist you. 
In your case, you cannot register for courses until your orientation day"
"93.	UH Financial Aid

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I am an admitted Freshmen, and I’m considering UH but was wondering where I view financial aid offers. I currently have nothing on my UH Self Service Aid Tab, but have 3 holds for student registration. I don’t know if I have to clear these holds before getting an offer, or if it just hasn’t been given out yet (Like UT).
Thanks!

school advisor replied:
Hi, 
Glad to help. 
The holds will only affect you around the time of registering for classes if you don’t complete it by July-August.
Offers are sent out late March early April for freshmen.
It depends on when you applied. If you applied before nov 1st or Jan 15th. You’re automatically considered for some financial aid. "
"94.	Easy MBA Courses

student's question:
Hi there, 
I'm trying to register for classes right now to finish out my last year next year. What are some of the easiest MBA courses in terms of time spent on assignments? Preferably none in the math-intensive (finance/accounting/stats) side, more case studies.

school advisor replied:
Hello sir, 
Pleased to assist. If you're trying to avoid math, I suggest you check one of those MANA courses. (mgmt in oil and gas). It consist of a midterm (4 write ups of 500 words or less), final exam (probably the same as the midterm), a class presentation and participation. Professor is really nice and GPA averages are high on cougar grades.

"99.	Incoming Freshman

student's question:
Hi sir, 
I need help please. Would you please tell me if UH really cover the rest of the tuition if my family's income is less than 60k? My FAFSA EFC is 0.
Thank you. 

school advisor replied:
Hi,
Don’t worry. 
If FAFSA says EFC is 0, you should be covered by financial aid for your full estimated cost of attendance which includes living expenses and transportation during the 9 month academic term only, but some of that may be work study and loans.
The Cougar Promise is that tuition and mandatory fees will be covered by grants (no loans). It does not cover room, board, transportation, health insurance, etc.
